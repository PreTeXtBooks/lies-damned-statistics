<div class="para">Let’s make a modified version of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eg-triangleDistr.html" title="Example 4.3.14">Example 4.3.14</a>. You are again throwing darts at a dartboard, but you notice that you are very left-handed so your throws pull to the right much more than they pull to the left. What this means is that it is not a very good model of your dart throws just to notice how far they are from the center of the dartboard, it would be better to notice the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-coordinate of where the dart hits, measuring (in <span class="process-math">\(cm\)</span>) with the center of the board at <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> location <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span> This will be your new choice of RV, which you will still call <span class="process-math">\(X\text{.}\)</span>
