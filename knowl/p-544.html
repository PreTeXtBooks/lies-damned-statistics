<div class="para">First of all, the frequentist point of view on probability tells us that what we are interested in is the probability that a randomly chosen adult American male will be taller than <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> feet — that will be the same as the percentage of the population this tall. In other words, we must find the probability that <span class="process-math">\(X&gt;72\text{,}\)</span> since in inches, <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> feet becomes <span class="process-math">\(72\text{.}\)</span> As <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is a continuous RV, we must find the area under its density curve, which is the <span class="process-math">\(\rho\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(N(69, 2.8)\text{,}\)</span> between <span class="process-math">\(72\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\infty\text{.}\)</span>
