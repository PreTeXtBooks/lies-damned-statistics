<div class="para">This means that <span class="process-math">\(N(\mu_X, \sigma_X)\)</span> models situations where the amount <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> deviates from its average has no particular cut-off in the positive or negative direction. So you are throwing darts at a dart board, for example, and there is no way to know how far your dart may hit to the right or left of the center, maybe even way off the board and down the hall — although that may be very unlikely. Or perhaps the time it takes to complete some task is usually a certain amount, but every once and a while it might take much more time, so much more that there is really no natural limit you might know ahead of time.</div>
