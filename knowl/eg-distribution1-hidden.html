<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"><div class="para">Let’s look at the RV, which we will call <span class="process-math">\(X\text{,}\)</span> in the silly betting game of Example <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eg-RV1.html" title="Example 4.3.2">Example 4.3.2</a>. As we noticed when we first defined that game, there are two possible values for this RV, $5 and -$5. We can actually think of “<span class="process-math">\(X=5\)</span>” as describing an event, consisting of the set of all outcomes of the coin-flipping experiment which give you a net gain of $5. Likewise, “<span class="process-math">\(X=-5\)</span>” describes the event consisting of the set of all outcomes which give you a net gain of -$5. These events are as follows:</div> <div class="para"><em class="emphasis">[Table showing: <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> column with values 5 and -5, and corresponding outcomes column with {H} and {T}]</em></div> <div class="para">Since it is a fair coin so the probabilities of these events are known (and very simple), we conclude that the distribution of this RV is the table</div> <div class="para"><em class="emphasis">[Distribution table: <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> = 5 with <span class="process-math">\(P(X=x) = 1/2\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> = -5 with <span class="process-math">\(P(X=x) = 1/2\)</span>]</em></div></article></body>
