<div class="para">Suppose we are told that we have two events <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> in the sample space <span class="process-math">\(S\text{,}\)</span> which satisfy <span class="process-math">\(P(A)=.4\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(P(B)=.5\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(P(A\cap B)=.1\text{.}\)</span> First of all, we know that <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> are not disjoint, since if they were disjoint, that would mean (by definition) that <span class="process-math">\(A\cap B=\emptyset\text{,}\)</span> and since <span class="process-math">\(P(\emptyset)=0\)</span> but <span class="process-math">\(P(A\cap B)\neq 0\text{,}\)</span> that is not possible. So we draw a Venn diagram that we’ve see before:</div> <div class="para"><em class="emphasis">[Figure: Two overlapping circles A and B]</em></div> <div class="para">However, it would be unwise simply to write those given numbers <span class="process-math">\(.4\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(.5\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(.1\)</span> into the three central regions of this diagram. The reason is that the number <span class="process-math">\(.1\)</span> is the probability of <span class="process-math">\(A\cap B\text{,}\)</span> which is a part of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> already, so if we simply write <span class="process-math">\(.4\)</span> in the rest of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> we would be counting that <span class="process-math">\(.1\)</span> for the <span class="process-math">\(A\cap B\)</span> twice. Therefore, before we write a number in the rest of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> outside of <span class="process-math">\(A\cap B\text{,}\)</span> we have to subtract the <span class="process-math">\(.1\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(P(A\cap B)\text{.}\)</span> That means that the number which goes in the rest of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> should be <span class="process-math">\(.4-.1=.3\text{.}\)</span> A similar reasoning tells us that the number in the part of <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> outside of <span class="process-math">\(A\cap B\text{,}\)</span> should be <span class="process-math">\(.5-.1=.4\text{.}\)</span> That means the Venn diagram with all probabilities written in would be:</div> <div class="para"><em class="emphasis">[Figure: Venn diagram with .3 in A only, .1 in overlap, .4 in B only, .2 outside both circles]</em></div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-defsforprob.html#eg-probnumsinVDs" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
