<div class="para">Actually, since outliers should be far away either in being significantly bigger than the rest of the data or in being significantly smaller, we should take a value on the upper side of the rest of the data, and another on the lower side, as the starting points for this <em class="emphasis">far away</em>.  We can’t pick the <span class="process-math">\(x_{max}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x_{min}\)</span> as those starting points, since they will be the outliers themselves, as we have noticed.  So we will use our earlier idea of a value which is typical for the larger part of the data, the quartile <span class="process-math">\(Q_3\)</span>, and <span class="process-math">\(Q_1\)</span> for the corresponding lower part of the data.</div>
