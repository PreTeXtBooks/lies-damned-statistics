<div class="para">There is a very hard mathematics competition in which college students in the US and Canada can participate called the <dfn class="terminology">William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition</dfn>. It consists of a six-hour long test with twelve problems, graded 0 to 10 on each problem, so the total score could be anything from 0 to 120.</div> <div class="para">The median score last year on the Putnam exam was 0 (as it often is, actually). What does this tell you about the scores of the students who took it? Be as precise as you can. Can you tell what fraction (percentage) of students had a certain score or scores? Can you figure out what the quartiles must be?</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-one-variable-exercises.html#exercise-7" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
