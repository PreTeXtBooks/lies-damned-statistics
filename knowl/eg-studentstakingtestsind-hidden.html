<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"><div class="para">Suppose we’re interested in studying whether doing more homework helps students do better in their studies. So shouldn’t the individuals be the students? Well, which students? How about we look only at college students. Which college students? OK, how about students at 4-year colleges and universities in the United States, over the last five years—after all, things might be different in other countries and other historical periods.</div> <div class="para">Wait, a particular student might sometimes do a lot of homework and sometimes do very little. And what exactly does “do better in their studies” mean? So maybe we should look at each student in each class they take, then we can look at the homework they did for that class and the success they had in it.</div> <div class="para">Therefore, the individuals in this study would be <em class="emphasis">individual experiences that students in US 4-year colleges and universities had in the last five years</em>, and population of the study would essentially be the collection of all the names on all class rosters of courses in the last five years at all US 4-year colleges and universities.</div></article></body>
