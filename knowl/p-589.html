<div class="para">Imagine you live on a street with a stop light at both ends of the block. You watch cars driving down the street and notice which ones have to stop at the <span class="process-math">\(1^{\text{st}}\)</span> and/or <span class="process-math">\(2^{\text{nd}}\)</span> light (or none). After counting cars and stops for a year, you have seen what a very large number — call it <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> — of cars did. Now imagine you decide to think about the experiment “<em class="emphasis">pick a car on this street from the last year at random and notice at which light or lights it has to stop</em>.”</div>
