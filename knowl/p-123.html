<div class="para">It is possible that in fact people are better off, as the increase in this average — mean — seems to imply.  But it is also possible that while the mean income has gone up, the <em class="emphasis">median</em> income is still low.  This would happen if the histogram of incomes recently still has most of the tall bars down where the variable (family income) is low, but has a few, very high outliers. In short, if the super-rich have gotten even super-richer, that will make the mean (average) go up, even if most of the population has experienced stagnant or decreasing wages — but the median will tell what is happening to most of the population.</div>
