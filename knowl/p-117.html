<div class="para">As one final point, note that as we mentioned in <a href="sec-NDoDIMotC.html#ssec-Mean" class="internal" title="Subsection 1.4.2: Mean">Subsection 1.4.2</a>, the word “average,” the unsophisticated version of “mean,” is often incorrectly used as a modifier of the individuals in some population being studied (as in “the average American ...”), rather than as a modifier of the variable in the study (“the average income...”), indicating a fundamental misunderstanding of what the mean <em class="emphasis">means</em>.  If you look a little harder at this misunderstanding, though, perhaps it is based on the idea that we are looking for the center, the “typical” value of the variable.</div>
