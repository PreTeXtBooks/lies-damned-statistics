<div class="para">There is, when we think about it, something of a problem here. A distribution is supposed to be a list of possible values of the RV and the probability of each such value. But if some continuous RV has values which are an interval of real numbers, there is just no way to list all such numbers — it has been known since the late 1800s that there is no way to make a list like that. In addition, the chance of some random process producing a real number that is <em class="emphasis">exactly</em> equal to some particular value really is zero: for two real numbers to be precisely equal requires infinite accuracy … think of all of those decimal digits, marching off in orderly rows to infinity, which must match between the two numbers.</div>
