<div class="para">Suppose that when people have kids, the chance of having a boy or a girl is the same. Suppose also that the sexes of successive children in the same family are independent. [Neither of these is exactly true in real life, but let’s pretend for this problem.]</div> <div class="para">The Wang family has two children. If we think of the sexes of these children as the result of a random experiment, what is the sample space? Note that we’re interested in birth order as well, so that should be apparent from the sample space.</div> <div class="para">What are the probabilities of each of the outcomes in your sample space? Why?</div> <div class="para">Now suppose we know that at least one of the Wang children is a boy. Given this information, what is the probability that the Wangs have two boys?</div> <div class="para">Suppose instead that we know that the Wangs’ older child is a boy. What is the probability, given this different information, that both Wang children are boys?</div> <div class="para">To solve this, clearly define events in words and with symbols, compute probabilities, and combine these to get the desired probability. Explain everything you do, of course.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-probability-exercises.html#exercise-21" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
