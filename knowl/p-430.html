<div class="para">We have described the whole foundation of the theory of probability as coming from <em class="emphasis">imperfect knowledge</em>, in the sense that we don’t know for sure if an event <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> will happen any particular time we do the experiment but we do know, in the long run, in what fraction of times <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> will happen. Or, at least, we claim that there is some number <span class="process-math">\(P(A)\)</span> such that after running the experiment <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> times, out of which <span class="process-math">\(n_A\)</span> of these times are when <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> happened, <span class="process-math">\(P(A)\)</span> is approximately <span class="process-math">\(n_A/N\)</span> (and this ratio gets closer and closer to <span class="process-math">\(P(A)\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> gets bigger and bigger).</div>
