<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"><div class="para">The period of economic difficulty for world markets in the late 2000s and early 2010s is sometimes called the <dfn class="terminology">Great Recession</dfn>.  Suppose a politician says that we have come out of that time of troubles, and gives as proof the fact that the average family income has increased from the low value it had during the Great Recession back to the values it had before then, and perhaps is even higher than it was in 2005.</div> <div class="para">It is possible that in fact people are better off, as the increase in this average — mean — seems to imply.  But it is also possible that while the mean income has gone up, the <em class="emphasis">median</em> income is still low.  This would happen if the histogram of incomes recently still has most of the tall bars down where the variable (family income) is low, but has a few, very high outliers. In short, if the super-rich have gotten even super-richer, that will make the mean (average) go up, even if most of the population has experienced stagnant or decreasing wages — but the median will tell what is happening to most of the population.</div> <div class="para">So when a politician uses the evidence of the average (mean) as suggested here, it is possible they are trying to hide from the public the reality of what is happening to the rich and the not-so-rich.  It is also possible that this politician is simply poorly educated in statistics and doesn’t realize what is going on.  You be the judge ... but pay attention so you know what to ask about.</div></article></body>
