<div class="para">Being good at this game, you hit near the center more than near the edge and you never completely miss the board, whose radius is <span class="process-math">\(10cm\)</span> — so <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is more likely to be near <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> than near <span class="process-math">\(10\text{,}\)</span> and it is never greater than <span class="process-math">\(10\text{.}\)</span> What this means is that the RV has values forming the interval <span class="process-math">\([0,10]\)</span> and the density function, defined on the same interval, should have its maximum value at <span class="process-math">\(x=0\)</span> and should go down to the value <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> when <span class="process-math">\(x=10\text{.}\)</span>
