<body class="ignore-math"><article class="exercise exercise-like"><div class="para">Suppose you pick 50 random adults across the United States in January 2017 and measure how tall they are.  For each of them, you also get accurate information about how tall their (biological) parents are.  Now, using as your individuals these 50 adults and as the two variables their heights and the average of their parents’ heights, make a sketch of what you think the resulting scatterplot would look like.  Explain why you made the choice you did of one variable to be the explanatory and the other the response variable. Tell what are the shape, strength, and direction you see in this scatterplot, if it shows a deterministic or non-deterministic association, and why you think those conclusions would be true if you were to do this exercise with real data.</div> <div class="para">Is there any time or place other than right now in the United States where you think the data you would collect as above would result in a scatterplot that would look fairly different in some significant way?  Explain!</div></article></body>
