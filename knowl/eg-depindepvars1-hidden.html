<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"><div class="para">Suppose we have a large warehouse of many different boxes of products ready to ship to clients.  Perhaps we have packed all the products in boxes which are perfect cubes, because they are stronger and it is easier to stack them efficiently.  We could do a study where</div> <ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">the <em class="emphasis">individuals</em> would be the boxes of product;</div></li>
<li><div class="para">the <em class="emphasis">population</em> would be all the boxes in our warehouse;</div></li>
<li><div class="para">the <em class="emphasis">independent variable</em> would be, for a particular box, the length of its side in <em class="emphasis">cm</em>;</div></li>
<li><div class="para">the <em class="emphasis">dependent variable</em> would be, for a particular box, the cost to the customer of buying that item, in US dollars.</div></li>
</ul> <div class="para">We might think that the size <em class="emphasis">determines</em> the cost, at least approximately, because the larger boxes contain larger products into which went more raw materials and more labor, so the items would be more expensive.  So, at least roughly, the size may be anything, it is a free or <em class="emphasis">independent</em> choice, while the cost is (approximately) determined by the size, so the cost is <em class="emphasis">dependent</em>.  Otherwise said, the size <em class="emphasis">explains</em> and the cost is the <em class="emphasis">response</em>.  Hence the choice of those variables.</div></article></body>
