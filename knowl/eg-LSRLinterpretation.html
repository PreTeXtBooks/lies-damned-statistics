<div class="para">Look one more time at the data on students’ homework and total course points in a statistics class from Example <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eg-LSRL.html" title="Example 3.1.3">Example 3.1.3</a>, and the the LSRL computed there.  We said that the slope of the LSRL was <span class="process-math">\(m=.754\)</span> and the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-intercept was <span class="process-math">\(b=26.976\text{.}\)</span>  In context, what this means, is that <em class="emphasis">On average, each additional point of homework corresponded to an increase of <span class="process-math">\(.754\)</span> total course points.</em>  We may hope that this is actually a causal relationship, that the extra work a student does to earn that additional point of homework score helps the student learn more statistics and therefore get <span class="process-math">\(.75\)</span> more total course points.  But the mathematics here does not require that causation, it merely tells us the increase in <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is <em class="emphasis">associated</em> with that much increase in <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Likewise, we can also conclude from the LSRL that <em class="emphasis">In general, a student who did no homework at all would earn about <span class="process-math">\(26.976\)</span> total course points.</em> Again, we cannot conclude that doing no homework <em class="emphasis">causes</em> that terrible final course point total, only that there is an association.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-AaIoLSRLs.html#eg-LSRLinterpretation" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
