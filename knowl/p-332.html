<div class="para">Suppose we collect data on two sections of a statistics course, in particular on how many hours per week the individual students study for the course and how they do in the course, measured by their total course points at the end of the semester.  It is possible that there is a strong positive correlation between these variables for each section by itself, but there is a strong negative correlation when we put all the students into one dataset.  In other words, it is possible that the rational advice, based on both individual sections, is <em class="emphasis">study more and you will do better in the course</em>, but that the rational advice based on all the student data put together is <em class="emphasis">study less and you will do better</em>.</div>
