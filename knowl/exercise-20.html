<div class="para">The most common last [family] name in the world seems to be Wang [or the variant Wong]. Approximately 1.3% of the global population has this last name.</div> <div class="para">The most common first name in the world seems to be Mohammad [or one of several variants]. Some estimates suggest that perhaps as many as 2% of the global population has this first name.</div> <div class="para">Can you tell, from the above information, what percentage of the world population has the name “Mohammad Wang?” If so, why and what would it be? If not, why not, and can you make any guess about what that percentage would be, anyway?</div> <div class="para"><em class="emphasis">[Hint: think of all the above percentages as probabilities, where the experiment is picking a random person on Earth and asking their name. Carefully describe some events for this experiment, relevant to this problem, and say what their probabilities are. Tell how combining events will or will not compute the probability of the desired event, corresponding to the desired percentage.]</em></div> <div class="para"><em class="emphasis">[Note: don’t bet on the numbers given in this problem being too accurate — they might be, but there is a wide range of published values for them in public information from different sources, so probably they are only a very crude approximation.]</em></div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-probability-exercises.html#exercise-20" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
