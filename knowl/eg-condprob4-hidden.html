<div class="para">We can now fully explain what was going on in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eg-finiteprobmod3.html" title="Example 4.1.19">Example 4.1.19</a>. The two fair dice were supposed to be rolled in a way that the first roll had no effect on the second — this exactly means that the dice were rolled <em class="emphasis">independently</em>. As we saw, this then means that each individual outcome of sample space <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> had probability <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{36}\text{.}\)</span> But the first roll having any particular value is independent of the second roll having another, <em class="emphasis">e.g.</em>, if <span class="process-math">\(A=\{11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16\}\)</span> is the event in that sample space of getting a <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> on the first roll and <span class="process-math">\(B=\{14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64\}\)</span> is the event of getting a <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> on the second roll, then events <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> are independent, as we check by using <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fact-indepevents.html" title="Assemblage: Fact">Fact</a>:</div>
