<div class="para">One technical thing that can be confusing about continuous RVs and their density functions is the question of whether we should write <span class="process-math">\(P(a&lt;X&lt;b)\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(P(a\le X\le b)\text{.}\)</span> But if you think about it, we really have three possible events here:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
A &amp;= \{\text{outcomes such that } X=a\},\\
M &amp;= \{\text{outcomes such that } a&lt;X&lt;b\},\text{ and}\\
B &amp;= \{\text{outcomes such that } X=b\}\ .
\end{align*}
</div>
<div class="para">Since <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> always takes on exactly one value for any particular outcome, there is no overlap between these events: they are all disjoint. That means that</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
P(A\cup M\cup B) = P(A)+P(M)+P(B) = P(M)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">where the last equality is because, as we said above, the probability of a continuous RV taking on exactly one particular value, as it would in events <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span> The same would be true if we added merely one endpoint of the interval <span class="process-math">\((a,b)\text{.}\)</span> To summarize:</div>
