<div class="para">Extrapolation is considered a bad, or at least risky, practice.  The idea is that we used the evidence in the dataset <span class="process-math">\(\{(x_1,y_1), \dots , (x_n,y_n)\}\)</span> to build the LSRL, but, by definition, all of this data lies in the interval on the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis from <span class="process-math">\(x_{min}\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(x_{max}\text{.}\)</span>  There is literally no evidence from this dataset about what the relationship between our chosen explanatory and response variables will be for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> outside of this interval.  So in the absence of strong reasons to believe that the precise linear relationship described by the LSRL will continue for more <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>’s, we should not assume that it does, and therefore we should not use the LSRL equation to guess values by extrapolation.</div>
