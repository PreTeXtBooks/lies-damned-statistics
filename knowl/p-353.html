<div class="para">Another question we might ask is: where does our uncertainty about the experimental results come from? From the beginnings of the scientific method through the turn of the <span class="process-math">\(20^{\text{th}}\)</span> century, it was thought that this uncertainty came from our incomplete knowledge of the system on which we were experimenting. So if the experiment was, say, flipping a coin, the precise amount of force used to propel the coin up into the air, the precise angular motion imparted to the coin by its position just so on the thumbnail of the person doing the flipping, the precise drag that the coin felt as it tumbled through the air caused in part by eddies in the air currents coming from the flap of a butterfly’s wings in the Amazon rainforest — all of these things could significantly contribute to changing whether the coin would eventually come up <em class="emphasis">heads</em> or <em class="emphasis">tails</em>. Unless the coin-flipper was a robot operating in a vacuum, then, there would just be no way to know all of these physical details with enough accuracy to predict the toss.</div>
