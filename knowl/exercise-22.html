<div class="para">Imagine you live on a street with a stop light at both ends of the block. You watch cars driving down the street and notice which ones have to stop at the <span class="process-math">\(1^{\text{st}}\)</span> and/or <span class="process-math">\(2^{\text{nd}}\)</span> light (or none). After counting cars and stops for a year, you have seen what a very large number — call it <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> — of cars did. Now imagine you decide to think about the experiment “<em class="emphasis">pick a car on this street from the last year at random and notice at which light or lights it has to stop</em>.”</div> <div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> be the event “<em class="emphasis">the car had to stop at the <span class="process-math">\(1^{\text{st}}\)</span> light</em>” and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> be the event “<em class="emphasis">the car had to stop at the <span class="process-math">\(2^{\text{nd}}\)</span> light</em>.” What else would you have to count, over your year of data collection, to estimate the probabilities of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and of <span class="process-math">\(B\text{?}\)</span> Pick some numbers for all of these variables and show what the probabilities would then be.</div> <div class="para">Make a Venn diagram of this situation. Label each of the four connected regions of this diagram (the countries, if this were a map) with a number from <span class="process-math">\(\textcircled{1}\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(\textcircled{4}\text{,}\)</span> then provide a key which gives, for each of these numbered regions, <dfn class="terminology">both</dfn> a formula in terms of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> unions, intersections, and/or complements, and then <dfn class="terminology">also</dfn> a description entirely in words which do not mention <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> or set operations at all. Then put a decimal number in each of the regions indicating the probability of the corresponding event.</div> <div class="para">Wait — for one of the regions, you can’t fill in the probability yet, with the information you’ve collected so far. What else would you have had to count over the data-collection year to estimate this probability? Make up a number and show what the corresponding probability would then be, and add that number to your Venn diagram.</div> <div class="para">Finally, using the probabilities you have chosen, are the events <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> independent? Why or why not? Explain in words what this means, in this context.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-probability-exercises.html#exercise-22" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
