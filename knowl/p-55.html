<div class="para">Another way of saying that is that we would be making bars whose heights were determined by how many scores were in each group of ten. Note there is still a question of into which bar a value right on the edge would count: <em class="emphasis">e.g.,</em> does the data value <span class="process-math">\(50\)</span> count in the bar to the left of that number, or the bar to the right? It doesn’t actually matter which side, but it is important to state which choice is being made.</div>
