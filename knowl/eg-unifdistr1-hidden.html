The bus also doesn’t stick perfectly to its schedule — but it is guaranteed to come at least every <span class="process-math">\(30\)</span> minutes. What this adds up to is the idea that your waiting time at the bus stop is a uniformly distributed RV on the interval <span class="process-math">\([0,30]\text{.}\)</span>
