<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"><div class="para">As we noted above, the heights of adult men in the United States, when measured in inches, give a RV <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> which is <span class="process-math">\(N(69, 2.8)\text{.}\)</span> What percentage of the population, then, is taller than <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> feet?</div> <div class="para">First of all, the frequentist point of view on probability tells us that what we are interested in is the probability that a randomly chosen adult American male will be taller than <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> feet — that will be the same as the percentage of the population this tall. In other words, we must find the probability that <span class="process-math">\(X&gt;72\text{,}\)</span> since in inches, <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> feet becomes <span class="process-math">\(72\text{.}\)</span> As <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is a continuous RV, we must find the area under its density curve, which is the <span class="process-math">\(\rho\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(N(69, 2.8)\text{,}\)</span> between <span class="process-math">\(72\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\infty\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">That <span class="process-math">\(\infty\)</span> is a little intimidating, but since the tails of the Normal distribution are very thin, we can stop measuring area when <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is some large number and we will have missed only a very tiny amount of area, so we will have a very good approximation. Let’s therefore find the area under <span class="process-math">\(\rho\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(x=72\)</span> up to <span class="process-math">\(x=1000\text{.}\)</span> This can be done in many ways:</div> <ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">With a wide array of online tools — just search for “online normal probability calculator.” One of these yields the value <span class="process-math">\(.142\text{.}\)</span>

<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\text{normalcdf(72, 1000, 69, 2.8)}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para"> which yields the value <span class="process-math">\(.1419884174\text{.}\)</span> The general syntax here is</div>
