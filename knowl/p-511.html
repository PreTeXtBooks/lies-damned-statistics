<div class="para">The good news about this complicated formula is that we don’t really have to do anything with it. We will collect some properties of the Normal distribution which have been derived from this formula, but these properties are useful enough, and other tools such as modern calculators and computers which can find specific areas we need under the graph of <span class="process-math">\(y=\rho(x)\text{,}\)</span> that we won’t need to work directly with the above formula for <span class="process-math">\(\rho(x)\)</span> again. It is nice to know that <span class="process-math">\(N(\mu_X, \sigma_X)\)</span> does correspond to a specific, known density function, though, isn’t it?</div>
