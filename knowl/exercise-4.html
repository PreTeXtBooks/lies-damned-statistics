<div class="para">Suppose you go to the supermarket every week for a year and buy a bag of flour, packaged by a major national flour brand, which is labelled as weighing <span class="process-math">\(1kg\text{.}\)</span> You take the bag home and weigh it on an extremely accurate scale that measures to the nearest <span class="process-math">\({1/100}^{th}\)</span> of a gram. After the 52 weeks of the year of flour buying, you make a histogram of the accurate weights of the bags. What do you think that histogram will look like? Will it be symmetric or skewed left or right (which one?), where will its center be, will it show a lot of variation/spread or only a little? Explain why you think each of the things you say.</div> <div class="para">What about if you buy a <span class="process-math">\(1kg\)</span> loaf of bread from the local artisanal bakery — what would the histogram of the accurate weights of those loaves look like (same questions as for histogram of weights of the bags of flour)?</div> <div class="para">If you said that those histograms were symmetric, can you think of a measurement you would make in a grocery store or bakery which would be skewed; and if you said the histograms for flour and loaf weights were skewed, can you think of one which would be symmetric? (Explain why, always, of course.) [If you think one of the two above histograms was skewed and one was symmetric (with explanation), you don’t need to come up with another one here.]</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-one-variable-exercises.html#exercise-4" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
