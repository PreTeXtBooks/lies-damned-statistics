<body class="ignore-math"><article class="exercise exercise-like"><div class="para">It actually turns out that it is not true that the more a person works, the more they produce … at least not always.  Data on workers in a wide variety of industries show that working more hours produces more of that business’s product for a while, but then after too many hours of work, keeping on working makes for almost no additional production.</div> <div class="para">Describe how you might collect data to investigate this relationship, by telling what individuals, population, sample, and variables you would use. Then, assuming the truth of the above statement about what other research in this area has found, make an example of a scatterplot that you think might result from your suggested data collection.</div></article></body>
