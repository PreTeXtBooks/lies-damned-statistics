<div class="para">Before we jump into the mathematical formalities, we should motivate two pieces of what we just said. First, why talk about <em class="emphasis">sets</em> of outcomes of the experiment instead of talking about individual outcomes? The answer is that we are often interested in sets of outcomes, as we shall see later in this book, so it is nice to set up the machinery from the very start to work with such sets. Or, to give a particular concrete example, suppose you were playing a game of cards and could see your hand but not the other players’ hands. You might be very interested in how likely is it that your hand is a winning hand, <em class="emphasis">i.e.</em>, what is the likelihood of the set of all possible configurations of all the rest of the cards in the deck and in your opponents’ hands for which what you have will be the winning hand? It is situations like this which motivate an approach based on <em class="emphasis">sets</em> of outcomes of the random experiment.</div>
