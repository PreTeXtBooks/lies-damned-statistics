<div class="para">Why do we take the square root in that sample standard deviation?  The answer is that the measure we build should have the property that if all the numbers are made twice as big, then the measure of spread should also be twice as big.  Or, for example, if we first started working with data measured in feet and then at some point decided to work in inches, the numbers would all be 12 times as big, and it would make sense if the measure of spread were also 12 times as big.</div>
