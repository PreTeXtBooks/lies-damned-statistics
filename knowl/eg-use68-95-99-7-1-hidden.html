</div> <div class="para">Well, it is true that <span class="process-math">\(72\approx71.8\text{,}\)</span> so we could use that fact and accept that we are only getting an approximate answer — an odd choice, given the availability of tools which will give us extremely precise answers, but let’s just go with it for a minute.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Let’s see, the above Rule tells us that</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
P(66.2&lt;X&lt;71.8)=P(\mu_X-\sigma_X&lt;X&lt;\mu_X+\sigma_X)=.68\ .

\begin{equation*}
P(X&lt;66.2\text{ or }X&gt;71.8) = 1 - P(66.2&lt;X&lt;71.8) = 1- .68 = .32\ .

</div>
<div class="para">Since the event “<span class="process-math">\(X&lt;66.2\)</span>” is disjoint from the event “<span class="process-math">\(X&gt;71.8\)</span>” (<span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> only takes on one value at a time, so it cannot be simultaneously less than 66.2 and greater than 71.8), we can use the simple rule for addition of probabilities:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
.32 = P(X&lt;66.2\text{ or }X&gt;71.8) = P(X&lt;66.2) + P(X&gt;71.8)\ .

<div class="para">Now, since the density function of the Normal distribution is symmetric around the line <span class="process-math">\(x=\mu_X\text{,}\)</span> the two terms on the right in the above equation are equal, which means that</div>

\begin{equation*}
P(X&gt;71.8) = \frac12\left(P(X&lt;66.2) + P(X&gt;71.8)\right) = \frac12 .32 = .16\ .
