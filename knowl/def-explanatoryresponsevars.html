<div class="para">In a situation with bivariate data, if one variable can take on any value without (significant) constraint it is called the <dfn class="terminology">independent variable</dfn>, while the second variable, whose value is (at least partially) controlled by the first, is called the <dfn class="terminology">dependent variable</dfn>.</div> <div class="para">Since the value of the dependent variable depends upon the value of the independent variable, we could also say that it is explained by the independent variable.  Therefore the independent variable is also called the <dfn class="terminology">explanatory variable</dfn> and the dependent variable is then called the <dfn class="terminology">response variable</dfn>
</div> <div class="para">Whenever we have bivariate data and we have made a choice of which variable will be the independent and which the dependent, we write <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> for the independent and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> for the dependent variable.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-TERoID.html#def-explanatoryresponsevars" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
