<div class="para">If you pick a person at random in a certain country on a particular date, you might be able to estimate the probability that the person had a certain height if you knew enough about the range of heights of the whole population of that country.

A=\text{``the random person is taller than } 1.829 \text{ meters (}6\text{ feet)''}

<div class="para">Because there is a genetic component to height, if you know that <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> happened, it would change your idea of how likely, given that knowledge, that <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> happened.
