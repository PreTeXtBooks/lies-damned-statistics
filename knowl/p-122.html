<div class="para">The period of economic difficulty for world markets in the late 2000s and early 2010s is sometimes called the <dfn class="terminology">Great Recession</dfn>.  Suppose a politician says that we have come out of that time of troubles, and gives as proof the fact that the average family income has increased from the low value it had during the Great Recession back to the values it had before then, and perhaps is even higher than it was in 2005.</div>
