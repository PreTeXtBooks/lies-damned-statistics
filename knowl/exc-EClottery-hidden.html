</div> <div class="para">First of all, let’s make <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> represent the <dfn class="terminology">net gain</dfn> a Lottery player would have for the various outcomes of playing — note that the ticket to play costs $2. How would you modify the above numbers to take into account the ticket costs?</div> <div class="para">Next, notice that the above table gives winning <dfn class="terminology">odds</dfn>, not probabilities. How will you compute the probabilities from those odds? Recall that saying something has odds of “1 in <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>” means that it tends to happen about once out of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> runs of the experiment. You might use the word <em class="emphasis">frequentist</em> somewhere in your answer here.</div> <div class="para">Finally, something is missing from the above table of outcomes. What prize — actually the most common one! — is missing from the table, and how will you figure out its probability?</div> <div class="para">After giving all of the above explanations, now write down the full, formal, probability distribution for this “net gain in <dfn class="terminology">EnergyCube</dfn> Lottery plays” random variable, <span class="process-math">\(X\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">In this problem, some of the numbers are quite small and will disappear entirely if you round them. So use a calculator or computer to compute everything here and keep as much accuracy as your device shows for each step of the calculation.</div></article></body>
