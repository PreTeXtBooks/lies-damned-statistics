Feel free to use an electronic device to make the plot for you, if you have one you know how to use, but copy the resulting picture into the homework you hand in, either by hand or cut-and-paste into an electronic version.</div> <div class="para">Describe the scatterplot, telling what are the shape, strength, and direction. What do you think would be the correlation coefficient of this dataset?  As always, explain all of your reasoning!</div></article></body>
