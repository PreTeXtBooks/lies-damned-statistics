<div class="para">After the turn of the <span class="process-math">\(20^{\text{th}}\)</span> century, matters got even worse (at least for physical determinists): a new theory of physics came along then, called <dfn class="terminology">Quantum Mechanics</dfn>, according to which true randomness is built into the laws of the universe. For example, if you have a very dim light source, which produces the absolutely smallest possible “chunks” of light (called <dfn class="terminology">photons</dfn>), and you shine it through first one polarizing filter and then see if it goes through a second filter at a <span class="process-math">\(45^\circ\)</span> angle to the first, then half the photons will get through the second filter, but there is <em class="emphasis">absolutely no way ever to predict whether any particular photon will get though or not</em>. Quantum mechanics is full of very weird, non-intuitive ideas, but it is one of the most well-tested theories in the history of science, and it has passed every test.</div>
