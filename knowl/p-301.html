<div class="para">Another important use of the (coefficients of the) LSRL is to use the underlying meanings of the slope and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-intercept.  For this, recall that in the equation <span class="process-math">\(y=mx+b\text{,}\)</span> the slope <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> tells us how much the line goes up (or down, if the slope is negative) for each increase of the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> by one unit, while the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-intercept <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> tells us what would be the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> value where the line crosses the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-axis, so when the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> has the value 0.  In each particular situation that we have bivariate quantitative data and compute an LSRL, we can then use these interpretations to make statements about the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.</div>
