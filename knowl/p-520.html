<div class="para">This means that the amount <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> misses its center, <span class="process-math">\(\mu_X\text{,}\)</span> tends to be about the same when it misses above <span class="process-math">\(\mu_X\)</span> and when it misses below <span class="process-math">\(\mu_X\text{.}\)</span> This would correspond to situations were you hit as much to the right as to the left of the center of a dartboard. Or when randomly picked people are as likely to be taller than the average height as they are to be shorter. Or when the time it takes a student to finish a standardized test is as likely to be less than the average as it is to be more than the average. Or in many, many other useful situations.</div>
