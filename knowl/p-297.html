<div class="para">The idea of interpolation is that we think the LSRL describes as well as possible the relationship between the independent and dependent variables, so that if we have a new <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> value, we’ll use the LSRL equation to predict what would be our best guess of what would be the corresponding <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span>  Note we might have a new value of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> because we simply lost part of our dataset and are trying to fill it in as best we can.  Another reason might be that a new individual came along whose value of the independent variable, <span class="process-math">\(x_0\text{,}\)</span> was typical of the rest of the dataset — so the the very least <span class="process-math">\(x_{min}\le x_0\le x_{max}\)</span> — and we want to guess what will be the value of the dependent variable for this individual before we measure it.  (Or maybe we cannot measure it for some reason.)</div>
