<div class="para">If the square of the correlation coefficient between the independent variable <em class="emphasis">how many hours a week a student studies statistics</em> and the dependent variable <em class="emphasis">how many points the student gets on the statistics final exam</em> is <span class="process-math">\(.64\text{,}\)</span> then 64% of the variation in scores for that class is cause by variation in how much the students study.  The remaining 36% of the variation in scores is due to other random factors like whether a student was coming down with a cold on the day of the final, or happened to sleep poorly the night before the final because of neighbors having a party, or some other issues different just from studying time.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-correlation.html#eg-rsquared" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
