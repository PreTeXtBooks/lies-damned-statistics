<div class="para">Notice that the mean in the two examples above was not one of the data values. This is true quite often.  What that means is that the phrase “the average <em class="emphasis">whatever</em>,” as in “the average American family has <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span>” or “the average student does <span class="process-math">\(Y\text{,}\)</span>” is not talking about any particular family, and we should not expect any particular family or student to have or do that thing.  Someone with a statistical education should mentally edit every phrase like that they hear to be instead something like “the mean of the variable <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> on the population of all American families is ...,” or “the mean of the variable <span class="process-math">\(Y\)</span> on the population of all students is ...,” or whatever.</div>
