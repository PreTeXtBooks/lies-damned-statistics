<div class="para">If you said that those histograms were symmetric, can you think of a measurement you would make in a grocery store or bakery which would be skewed; and if you said the histograms for flour and loaf weights were skewed, can you think of one which would be symmetric? (Explain why, always, of course.) [If you think one of the two above histograms was skewed and one was symmetric (with explanation), you don’t need to come up with another one here.]</div>
