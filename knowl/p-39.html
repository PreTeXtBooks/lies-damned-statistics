<div class="para">This is actually, in a strictly technical sense, a correct graph. But, looking at it, one might conclude that T seems to occur more than twice as often as H, so the coin is probably not fair… until a careful examination of the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-axis shows that even though the bar for T is more than twice as high as the bar for H, that is an artifact of how much of the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-axis is being shown.</div>
