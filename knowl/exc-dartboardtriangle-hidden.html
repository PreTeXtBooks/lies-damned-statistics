You are again throwing darts at a dartboard, but you notice that you are very left-handed so your throws pull to the right much more than they pull to the left. What this means is that it is not a very good model of your dart throws just to notice how far they are from the center of the dartboard, it would be better to notice the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-coordinate of where the dart hits, measuring (in <span class="process-math">\(cm\)</span>) with the center of the board at <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> location <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span> This will be your new choice of RV, which you will still call <span class="process-math">\(X\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">You throw repeatedly at the board, measure <span class="process-math">\(X\text{,}\)</span> and find out that you <em class="emphasis">never</em> hit more than <span class="process-math">\(10cm\)</span> to the right of the center, while you are more accurate to the left and never hit more than <span class="process-math">\(5cm\)</span> in that direction. You do hit the middle (<span class="process-math">\(X=0\)</span>) the most often, and you guess that the probability decreases linearly to those edges where you never hit.</div> <div class="para">Explain why your <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is a <em class="emphasis">continuous</em> RV, and what its interval <span class="process-math">\([x_{\min},x_{\max}]\)</span> of values is.</div> <div class="para">Now sketch the graph of the probability density function for <span class="process-math">\(X\text{.}\)</span> <em class="emphasis">[Hint: it will be a triangle, with one side along the interval of values <span class="process-math">\([x_{\min},x_{\max}]\)</span> on the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis, and its maximum at the center of the dartboard.]</em> Make sure that you put tick marks and numbers on the axes, enough so that the coordinates of the corners of the triangular graph can be seen easily. <em class="emphasis">[Another hint: it is a useful fact that the total area under the graph of any probability density function is <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span>]</em>
</div> <div class="para">What is the probability that your next throw will be in the bull’s-eye, whose radius, remember, is <span class="process-math">\(1.5cm\)</span> and which therefore stretches from <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> coordinate <span class="process-math">\(-1.5\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-coordinate <span class="process-math">\(1.5\text{?}\)</span>
