<div class="para">Here’s our last discussion of dartboards [maybe?]: One of the problems with the probability density function approaches from <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eg-triangleDistr.html" title="Example 4.3.14">Example 4.3.14</a> and <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/exc-dartboardtriangle.html" title="Checkpoint 4.4.10">Checkpoint 4.4.10</a> is the assumption that the functions were <em class="emphasis">linear</em> (at least in pieces). It would be much more sensible to assume they were more <em class="emphasis">bell-shaped</em>, maybe like the Normal distribution.</div> <div class="para">Suppose your friend Mohammad Wang is an excellent dart-player. He throws at a board and you measure the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-coordinate of where the dart goes, as in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/exc-dartboardtriangle.html" title="Checkpoint 4.4.10">Checkpoint 4.4.10</a> with the center corresponding to <span class="process-math">\(x=0\text{.}\)</span> You notice that his darts are rarely — only 5% of the time in total! — more than <span class="process-math">\(5cm\)</span> from the center of the board.</div> <div class="para">Fill in the blanks: “MW’s dart hits’ <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-coordinates are an RV <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> which is Normally distributed with mean <span class="process-math">\(\mu_X=\)</span>______ and standard deviation <span class="process-math">\(\sigma_X=\)</span>______.” Explain, of course.</div> <div class="para">How often does MW completely miss the dartboard?
