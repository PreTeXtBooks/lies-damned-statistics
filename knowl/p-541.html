<div class="para">It used to be that standardization was an important step in solving problems with Normal RVs. A problem would be posed with information about some data that was modelled by a Normal RV with given mean <span class="process-math">\(\mu_X\)</span> and standardization <span class="process-math">\(\sigma_X\text{.}\)</span> Then questions about probabilities for that data could be answered by standardizing the RV and looking up values in a single table of areas under the standard Normal curve.</div>
