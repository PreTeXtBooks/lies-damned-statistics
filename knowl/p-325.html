<div class="para">Using again the statistics students’ homework and total course points data from Example <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eg-LSRL.html" title="Example 3.1.3">Example 3.1.3</a>, suppose the course instructor wanted to predict what would be the total course points for a student who had earned a perfect <span class="process-math">\(100\)</span> points on their homework.  Plugging into the LSRL, this would have yielded a guess of <span class="process-math">\(.754\cdot100+26.976=102.376\text{.}\)</span>  Of course, this would have been impossible, since the maximum possible total course score was <span class="process-math">\(100\text{.}\)</span> Moreover, making this guess is an example of extrapolation, since the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> value of <span class="process-math">\(100\)</span> is beyond the largest <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> value of <span class="process-math">\(x_{max}=92\)</span> in the dataset. Therefore we should not rely on this guess — as makes sense, since it is invalid by virtue of being larger than <span class="process-math">\(100\text{.}\)</span>
