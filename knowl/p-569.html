<div class="para">Notice that .15%, or the proportion .0015, is not one of the numbers in the 68-95-99.7 Rule, nor is it one of their complements — but it is half of one of the complements, being half of .003. Now, .003 is the complementary probability to .997, which was the probability in the range <span class="process-math">\(\mu_X\pm3\sigma_X\text{.}\)</span> As we have seen already (twice), the complementary area to that in the region between <span class="process-math">\(\mu_X\pm3\sigma_X\)</span> consists of two thin tails which are of equal area, each of these areas being <span class="process-math">\(\frac12(1-.997)=.0015\text{.}\)</span> This all means that the beginning of that upper tail, above which value lies .15% of the population, is the <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> value <span class="process-math">\(\mu_X+3\sigma_X = 68 + 3\cdot2.8 = 77.4\text{.}\)</span>
