<div class="para">Suppose we look at the experiment of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eg-sampspace3.html" title="Example 4.1.4">Example 4.1.4</a> and add the information that the two dice we are rolling are <em class="emphasis">fair</em>. This actually isn’t quite enough to figure out the probabilities, since we also have to assure that the fair rolling of the first die doesn’t in any way affect the rolling of the second die. This is technically the requirement that the two rolls be <em class="emphasis">independent</em>, but since we won’t investigate that carefully until <a href="sec-condprob.html" class="internal" title="Section 4.2: Conditional Probability">Section 4.2</a>, below, let us instead here simply say that we assume the two rolls are fair and are in fact completely uninfluenced by anything around them in the world including each other.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">What this means is that, in the long run, we would expect the first die to show a <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> roughly <span class="process-math">\({\frac16}^{\text{th}}\)</span> of the time, and in the very long run, the second die would show a <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> roughly <span class="process-math">\({\frac16}^{\text{th}}\)</span> of <em class="emphasis">those</em> times. This means that the outcome of the “roll two dice” experiment should be <span class="process-math">\(11\)</span> with probability <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{36}\)</span> — and the same reasoning would show that all of the outcomes have that probability. In other words, this is an equiprobable sample space with <span class="process-math">\(36\)</span> outcomes each having probability <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{36}\text{.}\)</span> Which in turn enables us to compute any probability we might like, such as</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
P(\text{``sum of the two rolls is } 4\text{''}) &amp;= P(\{13, 22, 31\})\\
&amp;= \frac{1}{36} + \frac{1}{36} + \frac{1}{36}\\
&amp;= \frac{3}{36}\\
&amp;= \frac{1}{12}.
\end{align*}
