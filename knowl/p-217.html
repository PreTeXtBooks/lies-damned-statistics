<div class="para">All of the discussion so far has been for studies which have a single variable.  We may collect the values of this variable for a large population, or at least the largest sample we can afford to examine, and we may display the resulting data in a variety of graphical ways, and summarize it in a variety of numerical ways.  But in the end all this work can only show a single characteristic of the individuals.  If, instead, we want to study a <em class="emphasis">relationship</em>, we need to collect two (at least) variables and develop methods of descriptive statistics which show the relationships between the values of these variables.</div>
