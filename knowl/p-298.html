<div class="para">A common (but naive) alternate approach to interpolation for a value <span class="process-math">\(x_0\)</span> as above might be to find two values <span class="process-math">\(x_i\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x_j\)</span> in the dataset which were as close to <span class="process-math">\(x_0\)</span> as possible, and on either side of it (so <span class="process-math">\(x_i\lt x_0\lt x_j\)</span>), and simply to guess that the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-value for <span class="process-math">\(x_0\)</span> would be the average of <span class="process-math">\(y_i\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y_j\text{.}\)</span>  This is not a terrible idea, but it is not as effective as using the LSRL as described above, since we use the entire dataset when we build the coefficients of the LSRL.  So the LSRL will give, by the process of interpolation, the best guess for what should be that missing <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-value based on everything we know, while the “average of <span class="process-math">\(y_i\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y_j\)</span>” method only pays attention to those two nearest data points and thus may give a very bad guess for the corresponding <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-value if those two points are not perfectly typical, if they have any randomness, any variation in their <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-values which is not due to the variation of the <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span>
