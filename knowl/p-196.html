<div class="para">Suppose you go to the supermarket every week for a year and buy a bag of flour, packaged by a major national flour brand, which is labelled as weighing <span class="process-math">\(1kg\text{.}\)</span> You take the bag home and weigh it on an extremely accurate scale that measures to the nearest <span class="process-math">\({1/100}^{th}\)</span> of a gram. After the 52 weeks of the year of flour buying, you make a histogram of the accurate weights of the bags. What do you think that histogram will look like? Will it be symmetric or skewed left or right (which one?), where will its center be, will it show a lot of variation/spread or only a little? Explain why you think each of the things you say.</div>
