            Oddly enough, it is often a lack of clarity about <em>who</em> [or <em>what</em>]
            <em>you are looking at</em> which makes a lie out of statistics. Here are the
            terms, then, to keep straight:

                The units which are the objects of a statistical study are called the
                <term>individuals</term> in that study,
                while the collection of all such individuals is called the

            Note that while the term <q>individuals</q> sounds like it is talking about
            people, the individuals in a study could be things, even abstract things like

                The individuals in a study about a democratic election might be
                <em>the voters</em>. But if you are going to make an accurate
                prediction of who will win the election, it is important to be more precise
                about what exactly is the population of all of those individuals [voters]
                that you intend to study: is it <em>all eligible voters</em>, <em>all

                If you want to study if a coin is <q>fair</q> or not, you would flip it repeatedly.
                The individuals would then be <em>flips of that coin</em>, and the population
                might be something like <em>all the flips ever done in the past and all that
                will ever be done in the future</em>. These individuals are quite abstract, and
                in fact it is impossible ever to get your hands on all of them (the ones in the

              <p>
                Suppose we're interested in studying whether doing more homework helps students
                do better in their studies. So shouldn't the individuals be the students?
                Well, which students? How about we look only at college students. Which
                college students? OK, how about students at 4-year colleges and universities
                in the United States, over the last five years<mdash/>after all, things might be
                different in other countries and other historical periods.
              </p>
              <p>
                Wait, a particular student might sometimes do a lot of homework and sometimes
                do very little. And what exactly does <q>do better in their studies</q> mean? So
                maybe we should look at each student in each class they take, then we can look
                at the homework they did for that class and the success they had in it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Therefore, the individuals in this study would be <em>individual experiences
                that students in US 4-year colleges and universities had in the last five
                years</em>, and population of the study would essentially be the collection of all
                the names on all class rosters of courses in the last five years at all US
                4-year colleges and universities.

            When doing an actual scientific study, we are usually not interested so much

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>

          <p>
            The variable is something which (as the name says) <em>varies</em>, in the sense

            (although that is not necessary).

                There are several variables we might use in

                that course</em>. Both of those would be quantitative

              <p>
                A categorical variable for the same

            In many [most?] interesting studies, the population is too large for it to be
            practical to go observe the values of some interesting variable. Sometimes it
            is not just impractical, but actually impossible<mdash/>think of the example we gave
            of all the flips of the coin, even the ones in the future. So instead, we

            Later we shall discuss how to pick a good sample, and how much we can learn
            about a population from looking at the values of a variable of interest only
            for the individuals in a sample. For the rest of this chapter, however, let's
            just consider what to do with these sample values.

          <title>Visual Representation of Data, I: Categorical Variables</title>
          <p>
            Suppose we have a population and variable in which we are interested. We get
            a sample, which could be large or small, and look at the values of our
            variable for the individuals in that sample. We shall informally refer to
            this collection of values as a <term>dataset</term>.
          </p>

          <p>
            In this section, we suppose also that the variable we are looking at is
            categorical. Then we can summarize the dataset by telling which categorical
            values did we see for the individuals in the sample, and how often we saw
            those values.
          </p>

          <p>
            There are two ways we can make pictures of this information: <em>bar charts</em>
            and <em>pie charts</em>.

            <title>Bar Charts I: Frequency Charts</title>
            <p>
              We can take the values which we saw for individuals in the sample along the
              <m>x</m>-axis of a graph, and over each such label make a box whose height indicates
              how many individuals had that value<mdash/>the <term>frequency</term> of occurrence of
              that value.
            </p>

            <p>
              This is called a <term>bar chart</term>. As with all graphs, you
              should <em>always label all axes.</em> The <m>x</m>-axis will be labeled with some
              description of the variable in question, the <m>y</m>-axis label will always be
              <q>frequency</q> (or some synonym like <q>count</q> or <q>number of times</q>).

            <p>
              There is a variant of the above kind of bar chart which actually looks nearly
              the same but changes the labels on the <m>y</m>-axis. That is, instead of making
              the height of each bar be how many times each categorical value occurred, we
              could make it be <em>what fraction of the sample had that categorical

            <title>Bar Charts III: Cautions</title>
            <p>
              Notice that with bar charts (of either frequency or relative frequency) the
              variable values along the <m>x</m>-axis <em>can appear in any order whatsoever</em>.
              This means that any conclusion you draw from looking at the bar chart must
              not depend upon that order. For example, it would be foolish to say that the
              graph in <xref ref="eg-flipsbarchartfreq"/> <q>shows an increasing
              trend,</q> since it would make just as much sense to put the bars in the other
              order and then <q>show a decreasing trend</q><mdash/>both are meaningless.
            </p>

            <p>
              For relative frequency bar charts, in particular, note that the total of
              the heights of all the bars must be <m>1</m> (or <m>100\%</m>). If it is more, something
              is weird; if it is less, some data has been lost.
            </p>

            <p>
              Finally, it makes sense for both kinds of bar charts for the <m>y</m>-axis to
              run from the logical minimum to maximum. For frequency charts, this means it
              should go from <m>0</m> to <m>n</m> (the sample size). For relative frequency charts,
              it should go from <m>0</m> to <m>1</m> (or <m>100\%</m>). Skimping on how much of this
              appropriate <m>y</m>-axis is used is a common trick to lie with statistics.

              <title>Misleading Bar Chart with Bad Y-Axis</title>
              <statement>
                <p>
                  The coin we looked at in <xref ref="eg-flipsbarchartfreq"/> and
                  <xref ref="eg-flipsbarchartrelfreq"/> could well be a fair coin<mdash/>it didn't
                  show exactly half heads and half tails, but it was pretty close. Someone who
                  was trying to claim, deceptively, that the coin was not fair might have shown
                  only a portion of the <m>y</m>-axis, making the difference appear much more dramatic.

                </p>
                <p>
                  This is actually, in a strictly technical sense, a correct graph. But, looking
                  at it, one might conclude that T seems to occur more than twice as often as
                  H, so the coin is probably not fair<ellipsis/> until a careful examination of the
                  <m>y</m>-axis shows that even though the bar for T is more than twice as high as the
                  bar for H, that is an artifact of how much of the <m>y</m>-axis is being shown.
                </p>

            </example>

            <p>
              In summary, bar charts actually don't have all that much use in sophisticated
              statistics, but are extremely common in the popular press (and on web sites
              and so on).

              Another way to make a picture with categorical data is to use the fractions

                  wedges: one for H taking up 40% of the pie, and one for T taking up 60%.

            <p>
              Pie charts are widely used, but actually they are almost never a good choice.
              In fact, do an Internet search for the phrase <q>pie charts are bad</q> and there
              will be many hits. Many of the arguments are quite insightful.
            </p>

            <p>
              When you see a pie chart, it is either an attempt (misguided, though) by
              someone to be folksy and friendly, or it is a sign that the author is quite
              unsophisticated with data visualization, or, worst of all, it might be a sign
              that the author is trying to use mathematical methods in a deceptive way.
            </p>

            <p>
              In addition, all of the cautions we mentioned above for bar charts of
              categorical data apply, mostly in exactly the same way, for pie charts.

          <p>
            Now suppose we have a population and <em>quantitative</em>
            variable in which we
            are interested. We get a sample, which could be large or small, and look at
            the values of our variable for the individuals in that sample. There are
            two ways we tend to make pictures of datasets like this: <em>stem-and-leaf
            plots</em> and <em>histograms</em>.
          </p>
          <subsection xml:id="ssec-SalP">
            <title>Stem-and-leaf Plots</title>

            <idx>stem-and-leaf plot, stemplot</idx>
            <p>
              One somewhat old-fashioned way to handle a modest amount of quantitative data
              produces something between simply a list of all the data values and a graph.
              It's not a bad technique to know about in case one has to write down a dataset
              by hand, but very tedious <mdash/> and quite unnecessary, if one uses modern
              electronic tools instead <mdash/> if the dataset has more than a couple dozen values.
              The easiest case of this technique is where the data are all whole numbers in
              the range <m>0-99</m>. In that case, one can take off the tens place of each
              number <mdash/> call it the <term>stem</term> <mdash/> and put it on the
              left side of a vertical bar, and then line up all the ones places <mdash/> each is a
              <term>leaf</term> <mdash/> to the right of that stem. The whole
              thing is called a <term>stem-and-leaf plot</term>
              or, sometimes, just a <term>stemplot</term>.
            </p>

            <p>
              It's important not to skip any stems which are in the middle of the dataset,
              even if there are no corresponding leaves. It is also a good idea to allow
              repeated leaves, if there are repeated numbers in the dataset, so that the
              length of the row of leaves will give a good representation of how much
              data is in that general group of data values.

              The most important visual representation of quantitative data is a
              <term>histogram</term>. Histograms actually look a lot like a stem-and-leaf plot,
              except turned on its side and with the row of numbers turned into a vertical
              bar, like a bar graph. The height of each of these bars would be how many
            </p>

            <p>
              Another way of saying that is that we would be making bars whose heights were
              determined by how many scores were in each group of ten. Note there is still
              a question of into which bar a value right on the edge would count: <em>e.g.,</em>
              does the data value <m>50</m> count in the bar to the left of that number, or the
              bar to the right? It doesn't actually matter which side, but it is important
              to state which choice is being made.

                  put data values on the edges in the bar to the right <mdash/> we get the

            <p>
              Actually, there is no reason that the bars always have to be ten units wide:
              it is important that they are all the same size and that how they handle the
              edge cases (whether the left or right bar gets a data value on edge), but
              they could be any size. We call the successive ranges of the <m>x</m> coordinates
              which get put together for each bar the called
              <term>bins</term> or
              <term>classes</term>, and it is up to the statistician
              to chose whichever bins <mdash/> where they start and how wide they are <mdash/> shows the
              data best.
            </p>

            <p>
              Typically, the smaller the bin size, the more variation (precision) can be
              seen in the bars <ellipsis/> but sometimes there is so much variation that the result
              seems to have a lot of random jumps up and down, like static on the radio.
              On the other hand, using a large bin size makes the picture smoother <ellipsis/> but
              sometimes, it is so smooth that very little information is left. Some of this
              is shown in the following

              if the histogram is <q>noisy,</q> maybe multimodal. Similarly, looking at a
