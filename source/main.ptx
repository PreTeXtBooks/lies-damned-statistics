            Oddly enough, it is often a lack of clarity about <em>who</em> [or <em>what</em>]
            <em>you are looking at</em> which makes a lie out of statistics. Here are the
            terms, then, to keep straight:

                The units which are the objects of a statistical study are called the
                <term>individuals</term> in that study,
                while the collection of all such individuals is called the

            Note that while the term <q>individuals</q> sounds like it is talking about
            people, the individuals in a study could be things, even abstract things like

                The individuals in a study about a democratic election might be
                <em>the voters</em>. But if you are going to make an accurate
                prediction of who will win the election, it is important to be more precise
                about what exactly is the population of all of those individuals [voters]
                that you intend to study: is it <em>all eligible voters</em>, <em>all

                If you want to study if a coin is <q>fair</q> or not, you would flip it repeatedly.
                The individuals would then be <em>flips of that coin</em>, and the population
                might be something like <em>all the flips ever done in the past and all that
                will ever be done in the future</em>. These individuals are quite abstract, and
                in fact it is impossible ever to get your hands on all of them (the ones in the

              <p>
                Suppose we're interested in studying whether doing more homework helps students
                do better in their studies. So shouldn't the individuals be the students?
                Well, which students? How about we look only at college students. Which
                college students? OK, how about students at 4-year colleges and universities
                in the United States, over the last five years<mdash/>after all, things might be
                different in other countries and other historical periods.
              </p>
              <p>
                Wait, a particular student might sometimes do a lot of homework and sometimes
                do very little. And what exactly does <q>do better in their studies</q> mean? So
                maybe we should look at each student in each class they take, then we can look
                at the homework they did for that class and the success they had in it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Therefore, the individuals in this study would be <em>individual experiences
                that students in US 4-year colleges and universities had in the last five
                years</em>, and population of the study would essentially be the collection of all
                the names on all class rosters of courses in the last five years at all US
                4-year colleges and universities.

            When doing an actual scientific study, we are usually not interested so much

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>

            The variable is something which (as the name says) <em>varies</em>, in the sense

            (although that is not necessary).

                There are several variables we might use in

                that course</em>. Both of those would be quantitative

              <p>
                A categorical variable for the same

            In many [most?] interesting studies, the population is too large for it to be
            practical to go observe the values of some interesting variable. Sometimes it
            is not just impractical, but actually impossible<mdash/>think of the example we gave
            of all the flips of the coin, even the ones in the future. So instead, we

            Later we shall discuss how to pick a good sample, and how much we can learn
            about a population from looking at the values of a variable of interest only
            for the individuals in a sample. For the rest of this chapter, however, let's
            just consider what to do with these sample values.

          <title>Visual Representation of Data, I: Categorical Variables</title>
          <p>
            Suppose we have a population and variable in which we are interested. We get
            a sample, which could be large or small, and look at the values of our
            variable for the individuals in that sample. We shall informally refer to
            this collection of values as a <term>dataset</term>.
          </p>

          <p>
            In this section, we suppose also that the variable we are looking at is
            categorical. Then we can summarize the dataset by telling which categorical
            values did we see for the individuals in the sample, and how often we saw
            those values.
          </p>

          <p>
            There are two ways we can make pictures of this information: <em>bar charts</em>
            and <em>pie charts</em>.

            <title>Bar Charts I: Frequency Charts</title>
            <p>
              We can take the values which we saw for individuals in the sample along the
              <m>x</m>-axis of a graph, and over each such label make a box whose height indicates
              how many individuals had that value<mdash/>the <term>frequency</term> of occurrence of
              that value.
            </p>

            <p>
              This is called a <term>bar chart</term>. As with all graphs, you
              should <em>always label all axes.</em> The <m>x</m>-axis will be labeled with some
              description of the variable in question, the <m>y</m>-axis label will always be
              <q>frequency</q> (or some synonym like <q>count</q> or <q>number of times</q>).

            <p>
              There is a variant of the above kind of bar chart which actually looks nearly
              the same but changes the labels on the <m>y</m>-axis. That is, instead of making
              the height of each bar be how many times each categorical value occurred, we
              could make it be <em>what fraction of the sample had that categorical

            <title>Bar Charts III: Cautions</title>
            <p>
              Notice that with bar charts (of either frequency or relative frequency) the
              variable values along the <m>x</m>-axis <em>can appear in any order whatsoever</em>.
              This means that any conclusion you draw from looking at the bar chart must
              not depend upon that order. For example, it would be foolish to say that the
              graph in <xref ref="eg-flipsbarchartfreq"/> <q>shows an increasing
              trend,</q> since it would make just as much sense to put the bars in the other
              order and then <q>show a decreasing trend</q><mdash/>both are meaningless.
            </p>

            <p>
              For relative frequency bar charts, in particular, note that the total of
              the heights of all the bars must be <m>1</m> (or <m>100\%</m>). If it is more, something
              is weird; if it is less, some data has been lost.
            </p>

            <p>
              Finally, it makes sense for both kinds of bar charts for the <m>y</m>-axis to
              run from the logical minimum to maximum. For frequency charts, this means it
              should go from <m>0</m> to <m>n</m> (the sample size). For relative frequency charts,
              it should go from <m>0</m> to <m>1</m> (or <m>100\%</m>). Skimping on how much of this
              appropriate <m>y</m>-axis is used is a common trick to lie with statistics.

              <title>Misleading Bar Chart with Bad Y-Axis</title>
              <statement>
                <p>
                  The coin we looked at in <xref ref="eg-flipsbarchartfreq"/> and
                  <xref ref="eg-flipsbarchartrelfreq"/> could well be a fair coin<mdash/>it didn't
                  show exactly half heads and half tails, but it was pretty close. Someone who
                  was trying to claim, deceptively, that the coin was not fair might have shown
                  only a portion of the <m>y</m>-axis, making the difference appear much more dramatic.

                </p>
                <p>
                  This is actually, in a strictly technical sense, a correct graph. But, looking
                  at it, one might conclude that T seems to occur more than twice as often as
                  H, so the coin is probably not fair<ellipsis/> until a careful examination of the
                  <m>y</m>-axis shows that even though the bar for T is more than twice as high as the
                  bar for H, that is an artifact of how much of the <m>y</m>-axis is being shown.
                </p>

            </example>

            <p>
              In summary, bar charts actually don't have all that much use in sophisticated
              statistics, but are extremely common in the popular press (and on web sites
              and so on).

              Another way to make a picture with categorical data is to use the fractions
              from a relative frequency bar chart, but not for the heights of bars, instead

                  wedges: one for H taking up 40% of the pie, and one for T taking up 60%.

            <p>
              Pie charts are widely used, but actually they are almost never a good choice.
              In fact, do an Internet search for the phrase <q>pie charts are bad</q> and there
              will be many hits. Many of the arguments are quite insightful.
            </p>

            <p>
              When you see a pie chart, it is either an attempt (misguided, though) by
              someone to be folksy and friendly, or it is a sign that the author is quite
              unsophisticated with data visualization, or, worst of all, it might be a sign
              that the author is trying to use mathematical methods in a deceptive way.
            </p>

            <p>
              In addition, all of the cautions we mentioned above for bar charts of
              categorical data apply, mostly in exactly the same way, for pie charts.

          <p>
            Now suppose we have a population and <em>quantitative</em>
            variable in which we
            are interested. We get a sample, which could be large or small, and look at
            the values of our variable for the individuals in that sample. There are
            two ways we tend to make pictures of datasets like this: <em>stem-and-leaf
            plots</em> and <em>histograms</em>.
          </p>
          <subsection xml:id="ssec-SalP">
            <title>Stem-and-leaf Plots</title>

            <idx>stem-and-leaf plot, stemplot</idx>
            <p>
              One somewhat old-fashioned way to handle a modest amount of quantitative data
              produces something between simply a list of all the data values and a graph.
              It's not a bad technique to know about in case one has to write down a dataset
              by hand, but very tedious <mdash/> and quite unnecessary, if one uses modern
              electronic tools instead <mdash/> if the dataset has more than a couple dozen values.
              The easiest case of this technique is where the data are all whole numbers in
              the range <m>0-99</m>. In that case, one can take off the tens place of each
              number <mdash/> call it the <term>stem</term> <mdash/> and put it on the
              left side of a vertical bar, and then line up all the ones places <mdash/> each is a
              <term>leaf</term> <mdash/> to the right of that stem. The whole
              thing is called a <term>stem-and-leaf plot</term>
              or, sometimes, just a <term>stemplot</term>.
            </p>

            <p>
              It's important not to skip any stems which are in the middle of the dataset,
              even if there are no corresponding leaves. It is also a good idea to allow
              repeated leaves, if there are repeated numbers in the dataset, so that the
              length of the row of leaves will give a good representation of how much
              data is in that general group of data values.

              The most important visual representation of quantitative data is a
              <term>histogram</term>. Histograms actually look a lot like a stem-and-leaf plot,
              except turned on its side and with the row of numbers turned into a vertical
              bar, like a bar graph. The height of each of these bars would be how many
            </p>

            <p>
              Another way of saying that is that we would be making bars whose heights were
              determined by how many scores were in each group of ten. Note there is still
              a question of into which bar a value right on the edge would count: <em>e.g.,</em>
              does the data value <m>50</m> count in the bar to the left of that number, or the
              bar to the right? It doesn't actually matter which side, but it is important
              to state which choice is being made.

                  put data values on the edges in the bar to the right <mdash/> we get the

            <p>
              Actually, there is no reason that the bars always have to be ten units wide:
              it is important that they are all the same size and that how they handle the
              edge cases (whether the left or right bar gets a data value on edge), but
              they could be any size. We call the successive ranges of the <m>x</m> coordinates
              which get put together for each bar
              <term>bins</term> or
              <term>classes</term>, and it is up to the statistician
              to chose whichever bins <mdash/> where they start and how wide they are <mdash/> shows the
              data best.
            </p>

            <p>
              Typically, the smaller the bin size, the more variation (precision) can be
              seen in the bars <ellipsis/> but sometimes there is so much variation that the result
              seems to have a lot of random jumps up and down, like static on the radio.
              On the other hand, using a large bin size makes the picture smoother <ellipsis/> but
              sometimes, it is so smooth that very little information is left. Some of this
              is shown in the following

              if the histogram is <q>noisy,</q> maybe multimodal. Similarly, looking at a

          <title>Numerical Descriptions of Data, I: Measures of the Center</title>
          <p>
            Oddly enough, there are several measures of central tendency, as ways to
            define the middle of a dataset are called.  There is different work to be
            done to calculate each of them, and they have different uses, strengths, and
            weaknesses.
          </p>

          <p>
            For this whole section we will assume we have collected <m>n</m> numerical values,
            the values of our quantitative
            variable<idx>quantitative variable</idx><idx>variable!quantitative</idx> for the
            sample we were able to study.  When we write formulæ with these values,
            we can't give them variable names that look like <m>a, b, c, \dots</m>, because we
            don't know where to stop (and what would we do if <m>n</m> were more than 26?).
            Instead, we'll use the variables <m>x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n</m> to represent the data
            values.
          </p>

          <p>
            One more very convenient bit of notation, once we have started writing an
            unknown number (<m>n</m>) of numbers <m>x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n</m>, is a way of writing
            their sum:
          </p>

            <idx>pig, yellow</idx>
            <statement>
              <p>
                If we have <m>n</m> numbers which we write <m>x_1, \dots, x_n</m>, then we use the
                shorthand <term>summation notation</term> <m>\sum x_i</m> to represent the sum
                <m>\sum x_i = x_1 + \dots + x_n</m>.  <fn>Sometimes you will see this written
                instead <m>\sum_{i=1}^n x_i</m>.  Think of the <q><m>\sum_{i=1}^n{}</m></q>
                as a little computer program which with <m>i=1</m>, increases it one step at a time
                until it gets all the way to <m>i=n</m>, and adds up whatever is to the right.  So,
                for example, <m>\sum_{i=1}^3 2i</m> would be <m>(2*1)+(2*2)+(2*3)</m>, and so has the value <m>12</m>.</fn>

              What this example shows is that a small change in some of the data values,
              small enough not to change the histogram at all, can change the mode(s)
              drastically.  It also shows that the location of the mode says very little
              about the data in general or its shape, the mode is based entirely on a
              possibly accidental coincidence of some values in the dataset, no matter if

              the others, can change the mean quite a bit.  Here is an example.

                  there are now an odd number of data values, so the median is the middle one
                  after they are put in order, which is 78.  So the median has changed by only
                  half a point, from 77.5 to 78.   And this would even be true if the value we

              Since, in practice, it is very easy for datasets to have a few random, bad
              values (typos, mechanical errors, <em>etc.</em>), which are often outliers, it
              is usually smarter to use the median than the mean.
            </p>

            <p>
              As one final point, note that as we mentioned in <xref ref="ssec-Mean"/>, the
              word <q>average,</q> the unsophisticated version of <q>mean,</q> is often incorrectly
              used as a modifier of the individuals in some population being studied (as in
              <q>the average American ...</q>), rather than as a modifier of the variable in
              the study (<q>the average income...</q>), indicating a fundamental misunderstanding
              of what the mean <em>means</em>.  If you look a little harder at this
              misunderstanding, though, perhaps it is based on the idea that we are looking
              for the center, the <q>typical</q> value of the variable.
            </p>

            <p>
              The mode might seem like a good way <mdash/> it's the most frequently occurring
              value.  But we have seen how that is somewhat flawed.
            </p>

            <p>
              The mean might also seem like a good way <mdash/> it's the <q>average,</q> literally.
              But we've also seen problems with the mean.
            </p>

            <p>
              In fact, the median is probably closest to the intuitive idea of <q>the center
              of the data.</q>  It is, after all, a value with the property that both above
              and below that value lie half of the data values.
            </p>

            <p>
              One last example to underline this idea:
            </p>

            <example xml:id="eg-meanmedianincome">

              <idx>Great Recession</idx>
              <statement>
                <p>
                  The period of economic difficulty for world markets in the late 2000s and early
                  2010s is sometimes called the <term>Great Recession</term>.  Suppose a politician says
                  that we have come out of that time of troubles, and gives as proof the fact
                  that the average family income has increased from the low value it had during
                  the Great Recession back to the values it had before then, and perhaps is even
                  higher than it was in 2005.
                </p>

                <p>
                  It is possible that in fact people are better off, as the increase in this
                  average <mdash/> mean <mdash/> seems to imply.  But it is also possible that while the mean
                  income has gone up, the <em>median</em> income is still low.  This would happen
                  if the histogram of incomes recently still has most of the tall bars down
                  where the variable (family income) is low, but has a few, very high outliers.
                  In short, if the super-rich have gotten even super-richer, that will make the
                  mean (average) go up, even if most of the population has experienced stagnant
                  or decreasing wages <mdash/> but the median will tell what is happening to most of
                  the population.
                </p>

                <p>
                  So when a politician uses the evidence of the average (mean) as suggested here,
                  it is possible they are trying to hide from the public the reality of what is
                  happening to the rich and the not-so-rich.  It is also possible that this
                  politician is simply poorly educated in statistics and doesn't realize what is
                  going on.  You be the judge ... but pay attention so you know what to ask about.

              The last thing we need to say about the strengths and weaknesses of our
              different measures of central tendency is a way to use the weaknesses of the
              mean and median to our advantage.  That is, since the mean is sensitive to
              outliers<idx>sensitive to outliers</idx>, and pulled in the direction of those outliers, while the median is
              not, we can use the difference between the two to tell us which way a histogram

              The simplest<mdash/>and least useful<mdash/>measure of the spread<idx>spread of a histogram, dataset, or distribution</idx> of
              some data is literally how much space on the <m>x</m>-axis the histogram takes up.
              To define this, first a bit of convenient notation:

              The thing to notice here is that since the idea of outliers is that they are

              will definitely be what value gets called <m>x_{min}</m> or <m>x_{max}</m> (or both).  So
              <term>the range is supremely sensitive to outliers</term><idx>sensitive to outliers</idx>: if there are any outliers,
              the range will be determined exactly by them, and not by what the typical data

            <p>
              Let's try to find a substitute for the range which is not so sensitive to
              outliers.  We want to see how far apart not the maximum and minimum of the
              whole dataset are, but instead how far apart are the typical larger
              values in the dataset and the typical smaller values.  How can we measure
              these typical larger and smaller?  One way is to define these in terms of the
              typical<mdash/>central<mdash/>value of the upper half of the data and the typical
              value of the lower half of the data.  Here is the definition we shall use for
              that concept:

              Note that the first quartile is halfway through the lower half of the data.
              In other words, it is a value such that one quarter of the data is smaller.

              build one.
            </p>

            <p>
              Suppose the data is sample data.  Then how far a particular data value <m>x_i</m>
              is from the sample mean <m>\overline{x}</m><idx>sample mean, <m>\overline{x}</m></idx><idx><h>mean</h><h>sample</h></idx><idx><h>notation</h><h><m>\overline{x}</m>, sample mean</h></idx>
              is just <m>x_i-\overline{x}</m>.  So the mean displacement from the mean, the mean
              of <m>x_i-\overline{x}</m>, should be a good measure of variability, shouldn't it?
            </p>

            <p>
              Unfortunately, it turns out that the mean of
              <m>x_i-\overline{x}</m><idx>sample mean, <m>\overline{x}</m></idx><idx><h>mean</h><h>sample</h></idx><idx><h>notation</h><h><m>\overline{x}</m>, sample mean</h></idx> is always 0.  This
              is because when <m>x_i>\overline{x}</m>, <m>x_i-\overline{x}</m> is positive, while
              when <m>x_i&lt;\overline{x}</m>, <m>x_i-\overline{x}</m> is negative, and it turns out
              that the positives always exactly cancel the negatives (see if you can prove
              this algebraically, it's not hard).
            </p>

            <p>
              We therefore need to make the numbers

              taking their mean.  One way to do this is to square them all.  Then we take
              something which is almost the mean of these squared numbers to get another
              measure of spread<idx>spread of a histogram, dataset, or distribution</idx> or variability:

            <p>
              Why do we take the square root in that sample standard deviation?  The answer
              is that the measure we build should have the property that if all the numbers
              are made twice as big, then the measure of spread<idx>spread of a histogram, dataset, or distribution</idx> should also be
              twice as big.  Or, for example, if we first started working with data measured
              in feet and then at some point decided to work in inches, the numbers would
              all be 12 times as big, and it would make sense if the measure of spread were
              also 12 times as big.
            </p>

            <p>
              The variance does not have this property: if the data are all doubled, the
              variance increases by a factor of 4.  Or if the data are all multiplied by 12,
              the variance is multiplied by a factor of 144.
            </p>

            <p>
              If we take the square root of the variance, though, we get back to the nice
              property of doubling data doubles the measure of spread<idx>spread of a histogram, dataset, or distribution</idx>,
              <em>etc.</em>  For this reason, while we have defined the variance on its own
              and some calculators, computers, and on-line tools will tell the variance
              whenever you ask them to computer 1-variable statistics, we will in this
              class only consider the variance a stepping stone on the way to the real
              measure of spread of data, the standard deviation.
            </p>

            <p>
              One last thing we should define in this section.  For technical reasons that
              we shall not go into now, the definition of standard deviation is slightly
              different if we are working with population data and not sample data:

          <subsection xml:id="ssec-AFDoO">
            <title>A Formal Definition of Outliers<mdash/>the <m>1.5\,IQR</m> Rule</title>
            <p>
              So far, we have said that outliers<idx>outlier</idx> are simply data that are
              <em>atypical</em>.  We need a precise definition that can be carefully checked.
              What we will use is a formula (well, actually two formulæ) that describe
              that idea of an outlier being <em>far away from the rest of data</em>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Actually, since outliers should be far away either in being significantly
              bigger than the rest of the data or in being significantly smaller, we should
              take a value on the upper side of the rest of the data, and another on the
              lower side, as the starting points for this <em>far away</em>.  We can't pick
              the <m>x_{max}</m><idx><h>notation</h><h><m>x_{max}</m>, maximum value in dataset</h></idx> and
              <m>x_{min}</m><idx><h>notation</h><h><m>x_{min}</m>, minimum value in dataset</h></idx> as those starting
              points, since they will be the outliers themselves, as we have noticed.  So
              we will use our earlier idea of a value which is typical for the larger part
              of the data, the quartile<idx>quartile</idx> <m>Q_3</m><idx><h>notation</h><h><m>Q_3</m>, third quartile</h></idx>,
              and <m>Q_1</m><idx><h>notation</h><h><m>Q_1</m>, first quartile</h></idx> for the corresponding
              lower part of the data.
            </p>

            <p>
              Now we need to decide how far is <em>far enough away</em> from those quartiles
              to count as an outlier.  If the data already has a lot of variation, then a
              new data value would have to be quite far in order for us to be sure that it
              is not out there just because of the variation already in the data.  So our
              measure of <em>far enough</em> should be in terms of a measure of
              spread<idx>spread of a histogram, dataset, or distribution</idx> of the data.
            </p>

            <p>
              Looking at the last section, we see that only the
              <m>IQR</m><idx><h>notation</h><h><m>IQR</m>, inter-quartile range</h></idx> is a measure of
              spread<idx>spread of a histogram, dataset, or distribution</idx> which is insensitive to outliers<idx>insensitive to outliers</idx><mdash/>and we definitely
              don't want to use a measure which is sensitive to the outliers<idx>sensitive to outliers</idx>, one which
              would have been affected by the very outliers we are trying to define.

                Suppose you go to the supermarket every week for a year and buy a bag of
                flour, packaged by a major national flour brand, which is labelled as weighing
                <m>1kg</m>. You take the bag home and weigh it on an extremely accurate scale
                that measures to the nearest <m>{1/100}^{th}</m> of a gram. After the 52 weeks of
                the year of flour buying, you make a histogram of the accurate weights of the
                bags. What do you think that histogram will look like? Will it be symmetric
                or skewed left or right (which one?), where will its center be, will it show
                a lot of variation/spread or only a little? Explain why you think each of
                the things you say.

                What about if you buy a <m>1kg</m> loaf of bread from the local artisanal bakery

              <p>
                If you said that those histograms were symmetric, can you think of a
                measurement you would make in a grocery store or bakery which would be
                skewed; and if you said the histograms for flour and loaf weights were skewed,
                can you think of one which would be symmetric? (Explain why, always, of
                course.) [If you think one of the two above histograms was skewed and one was
                symmetric (with explanation), you don't need to come up with another one here.]

            All of the discussion so far has been for studies which have a single
            variable.  We may collect the values of this variable for a large population,
            or at least the largest sample we can afford to examine, and we may display
            the resulting data in a variety of graphical ways, and summarize it in a
            variety of numerical ways.  But in the end all this work can only show a
            single characteristic of the individuals.  If, instead, we want to study a
            <em>relationship</em>, we need to collect two (at least) variables and develop
            methods of descriptive statistics which show the relationships between the
            values of these variables.
          </p>
          <p>
            Relationships in data require at least two variables.  While more complex
            relationships can involve more, in this chapter we will start the project of
            understanding <em>bivariate data</em><idx>bivariate data</idx>, data where we make
            two observations for each individual, where we have exactly two variables.
          </p>
          <p>
            If there is a relationship between the two variables we are studying, the
            most that we could hope for would be that that relationship is due to the
            fact that one of the variables <em>causes</em> the other.  In this situation,
            we have special names for these variables
          </p>

                In a situation with bivariate data, if one variable can take on any value
                without (significant) constraint it is called the <term>independent variable</term><idx>independent variable</idx><idx><h>variable</h><h>independent</h></idx>, while the second
                variable, whose value is (at least partially) controlled by the first, is called
                the <term>dependent variable</term><idx>dependent variable</idx><idx><h>variable</h><h>dependent</h></idx>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since the value of the dependent variable depends upon the value of the
                independent variable, we could also say that it is explained by the
                independent variable.  Therefore the independent variable is also called the
                <term>explanatory variable</term><idx>explanatory variable</idx><idx><h>variable</h><h>explanatory</h></idx> and the dependent variable is then called the

              </p>

                Whenever we have bivariate data and we have made a choice of which variable
                will be the independent and which the dependent, we write <m>x</m> for the
                independent and <m>y</m> for the dependent variable.

                Suppose we have a large warehouse of many different boxes of products ready to
                ship to clients.  Perhaps we have packed all the products in boxes which are
                perfect cubes, because they are stronger and it is easier to stack them
                efficiently.  We could do a study where

              <ul>
                <li><p>the <em>individuals</em> would be the boxes of product;</p></li>

                We might think that the size <em>determines</em> the cost, at least approximately,
                because the larger boxes contain larger products into which went more raw
                materials and more labor, so the items would be more expensive.  So, at least
                roughly, the size may be anything, it is a free or <em>independent</em> choice,
                while the cost is (approximately) determined by the size, so the cost is
                <em>dependent</em>.  Otherwise said, the size <em>explains</em> and the cost is the
                <em>response</em>.  Hence the choice of those variables.

            There is one quite important difference between the two examples above: in
            one case (the cost), knowing the length of the side of a box gives us a hint
            about how much it costs (bigger boxes cost more, smaller boxes cost less) but
            this knowledge is imperfect (sometimes a big box is cheap, sometimes a small
            box is expensive); while in the other case (the volume), knowing the length of
            the side of the box perfectly tells us the volume.  In fact, there is a
            simple geometric formula that the volume <m>V</m> of a cube of side length <m>s</m> is
            given by <m>V=s^3</m>.

                in a wide variety of industries show that working more hours produces more of
                that business's product for a while, but then after too many hours of work,
                keeping on working makes for almost no additional production.

                Then, assuming the truth of the above statement about what other research in
                this area has found, make an example of a scatterplot that you think might
                result from your suggested data collection.

          Recall the equation of a line is usually in the form <m>y=mx+b</m>, where <m>x</m> and
          <m>y</m> are variables and <m>m</m> and <m>b</m> are numbers.  Some basic facts about lines:

          <li>
            <p>
              If you are given a number for <m>x</m>, you can plug it in to the equation
              <m>y=mx+b</m> to get a number for <m>y</m>, which together give you a point with

            <p>
              <m>m</m> is the <em>slope</em><idx>slope of a line</idx>, which tells how much the
              line goes up (increasing <m>y</m>) for every unit you move over to the right
              (increasing <m>x</m>) <mdash/> we often say that the value of the slope is

              if you look at how much the line goes up in each step of one unit to the right,

                Given a bivariate quantitative dataset and associated LSRL with equation
                <m>\widehat{y}=mx+b</m>, the process of guessing that the value of the dependent
                variable in this relationship to have the value <m>mx_0+b</m>, for <m>x_0</m> any
                value for the independent variable which satisfies <m>x_{min}\le x_0\le x_{max}</m>,

          <p>
            The idea of interpolation is that we think the LSRL describes as well as
            possible the relationship between the independent and dependent variables, so
            that if we have a new <m>x</m> value, we'll use the LSRL equation to predict what
            would be our best guess of what would be the corresponding <m>y</m>.  Note we
            might have a new value of <m>x</m> because we simply lost part of our dataset and
            are trying to fill it in as best we can.  Another reason might be that a new
            individual came along whose value of the independent variable, <m>x_0</m>, was
            typical of the rest of the dataset <mdash/> so the the very least
            <m>x_{min}\le x_0\le x_{max}</m> <mdash/> and we want to guess what will be the value of the
            dependent variable for this individual before we measure it.  (Or maybe we
            cannot measure it for some reason.)
          </p>
          
          <p>
            A common (but naive) alternate approach to interpolation for a value <m>x_0</m> as
            above might be to find two values <m>x_i</m> and <m>x_j</m> in the dataset which were
            as close to <m>x_0</m> as possible, and on either side of it (so <m>x_i\lt x_0\lt x_j</m>),
            and simply to guess that the <m>y</m>-value for <m>x_0</m> would be the average of
            <m>y_i</m> and <m>y_j</m>.  This is not a terrible idea, but it is not as effective as
            using the LSRL as described above, since we use the entire dataset when we
            build the coefficients of the LSRL.  So the LSRL will give, by the process of
            interpolation, the best guess for what should be that missing <m>y</m>-value based

            pays attention to those two nearest data points and thus may give a very bad
            guess for the corresponding <m>y</m>-value if those two points are not perfectly

                Working with the statistics students' homework and total course points data
                from Example <xref ref="eg-LSRL"/>, suppose the gradebook of the course instructor
                was somewhat corrupted and the instructor lost the final course points of
                the student Janet.  If Janet's homework points of 77 were not in the corrupted
                part of the gradebook, the instructor might use interpolation to guess what
                Janet's total course point probably were.  To do this, the instructor would
                have plugged in <m>x=77</m> into the equation of the LSRL, <m>\widehat{y}=mx+b</m>
                to get the estimated total course points of <m>.754\cdot77+26.976=85.034</m>.

          <p>
            Another important use of the (coefficients of the) LSRL is to use the
            underlying meanings of the slope and <m>y</m>-intercept.  For this, recall that
            in the equation <m>y=mx+b</m>, the slope <m>m</m> tells us how much the line goes up
            (or down, if the slope is negative) for each increase of the <m>x</m> by one unit,
            while the <m>y</m>-intercept <m>b</m> tells us what would be the <m>y</m> value where the
            line crosses the <m>y</m>-axis, so when the <m>x</m> has the value 0.  In each particular
            situation that we have bivariate quantitative data and compute an LSRL, we
            can then use these interpretations to make statements about the relationship
            between the independent and dependent variables.

                Look one more time at the data on students' homework and total course points
                in a statistics class from Example <xref ref="eg-LSRL"/>, and the the LSRL computed
                there.  We said that the slope of the LSRL was <m>m=.754</m> and the <m>y</m>-intercept
                was <m>b=26.976</m>.  In context, what this means, is that <em>On average, each
                additional point of homework corresponded to an increase of <m>.754</m> total
                course points.</em>  We may hope that this is actually a causal relationship,
                that the extra work a student does to earn that additional point of homework
                score helps the student learn more statistics and therefore get <m>.75</m> more
                total course points.  But the mathematics here does not require that
                causation, it merely tells us the increase in <m>x</m> is <em>associated</em> with
                that much increase in <m>y</m>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Likewise, we can also conclude from the LSRL that <em>In general, a student
                who did no homework at all would earn about <m>26.976</m> total course points.</em>
                Again, we cannot conclude that doing no homework <em>causes</em> that terrible
                final course point total, only that there is an association.

            <p>
              The attentive reader will have noticed that we started our discussion of
              bivariate data by saying we hoped to study when one thing <em>causes</em> another.
              However, what we've actually done instead is find <em>correlation</em> between
              variables, which is quite a different thing.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Now philosophers have discussed what exactly causation <em>is</em> for
              millennia, so certainly it is a subtle issue that we will not resolve here.
              In fact, careful statisticians usually dodge the complexities by talking about
              <em>relationships</em>, <em>association</em>, and, of course, the
              <em>correlation coefficient</em>, being careful always not to commit to
              <em>causation</em><idx>causation</idx> <mdash/> at least based only on an analysis of the
              statistical data.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              As just one example, where we spoke about the meaning of the square <m>r^2</m> of
              the correlation coefficient (we called it Fact <xref ref="fact-rsquared"/>), we were
              careful to say that <m>r^2</m> measures the variation of the dependent variable
              which is <em>associated</em> with the variation of the independent variable.
              A more reckless description would have been to say that one <em>caused</em> the
              other <mdash/> but don't fall into that trap!
            </p>
            
            <p>
              This would be a bad idea because (among other reasons) the correlation
              coefficient is symmetric in the choice of explanatory and response variables
              (meaning <m>r</m> is the same no matter which is chosen for which role), while any
              reasonable notion of causation is asymmetric.  <em>E.g.,</em> while the
              correlation is exactly the same very large value with either variable being
              <m>x</m> and which <m>y</m>, most people would say that <em>smoking causes cancer</em> and
              not the other way!
            </p>
            
            <p>
              We do need to make one caution about this caution, however.  If there is a
              causal relationship between two variables that are being studied carefully,
              then there will be correlation.  So, to quote the great data scientist
              Edward Tufte<idx>Tufte, Edward</idx>,
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                <em>Correlation is not causation but it sure is a
                hint.</em><idx><h>correlation is not causation</h><h>but it sure is a hint</h></idx>
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>
              The first part of this quote (up to the <q>but</q>) is much more famous and, as
              a very first step, is a good slogan to live by.  Those with a bit more
              statistical sophistication might instead learn this version, though.  A more
              sophisticated-sounding version, again due to Tufte,
              is

            <blockquote>

              coefficient tells us there is a strong linear association.  If the diligent

              the resulting line looked much like the line which <term>LibreOffice Calc</term><idx>LibreOffice Calc</idx><idx><h>Calc</h><h>LibreOffice</h></idx> produced
              <mdash/> except humans usually sketch their line all the way to the left and right

              Extrapolation is considered a bad, or at least risky, practice.  The idea is
              that we used the evidence in the dataset <m>\{(x_1,y_1), \dots , (x_n,y_n)\}</m> to
              build the LSRL, but, by definition, all of this data lies in the interval on
              the <m>x</m>-axis from <m>x_{min}</m> to <m>x_{max}</m>.  There is literally no evidence from
              this dataset about what the relationship between our chosen explanatory and
              response variables will be for <m>x</m> outside of this interval.  So in the absence
              of strong reasons to believe that the precise linear relationship described
              by the LSRL will continue for more <m>x</m>'s, we should not assume that it does,
              and therefore we should not use the LSRL equation to guess values by
              extrapolation.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              The fact is, however, that often the best thing we can do with available
              information when we want to make predictions out into uncharted territory on
              the <m>x</m>-axis is extrapolation.  So while it is perilous, it is reasonable to
              extrapolate, so long as you are clear about what exactly you are doing.

                  Suppose we collect data on two sections of a statistics course, in particular
                  on how many hours per week the individual students study for the course and
                  how they do in the course, measured by their total course points at the end of
                  the semester.  It is possible that there is a strong positive correlation
                  between these variables for each section by itself, but there is a strong
                  negative correlation when we put all the students into one dataset.  In other
                  words, it is possible that the rational advice, based on both individual
                  sections, is <em>study more and you will do better in the course</em>, but that
                  the rational advice based on all the student data put together is
                  <em>study less and you will do better</em>.

                The age (<m>x</m>) and resting heart rate (RHR, <m>y</m>) were measured
                for nine men, yielding this dataset:

                Based on the scatterplot, what do you think the correlation coefficient <m>r</m> will

                Compute the LSRL for these data, write down its equation, and sketch it on top

                [You may, of course, do as much of this with electronic tools as you
                like.  However, you should explain what tool you are using, how you used it,

                displayed and you are turning in.]

                Continuing with the data and computations of the previous

              </p>
              <p>
                What percentage of the variation in RHR is associated with variation in age?

              <p>
                Write the following sentences with blanks filled in: <q>If I measured the RHR of
                a 55 year-old man, I would expect it to be <m>\underline{\hphantom{XXXX}}</m>.
                Making an estimate like this is called <m>\underline{\hphantom{XXXXXXXXXXX}}</m>.</q>

              <p>
                Just looking at the equation of the LSRL, what does it suggest should be the
                RHR of a newborn baby?  Explain.
              </p>
              <p>
                Also explain what an estimate like yours for the RHR of a baby is called.  This
                kind of estimate is considered a bad idea in many cases <mdash/> explain why in
                general, and also use specifics from this particular case.

                What is the correlation coefficient of your dataset?

                Next, add one more point to the dataset in such a way that you don't change the
                LSRL or correlation coefficient.

              <p>
                Finally, can you find a dataset with the same LSRL but having a larger

                you already found in this problem, using an electronic tool to do all the
                computational work.  When you find a good one, write it down and explain what
