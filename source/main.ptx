            Oddly enough, it is often a lack of clarity about <em>who</em> [or <em>what</em>]
            <em>you are looking at</em> which makes a lie out of statistics. Here are the
            terms, then, to keep straight:

                The units which are the objects of a statistical study are called the
                <term>individuals</term> in that study,
                while the collection of all such individuals is called the

            Note that while the term <q>individuals</q> sounds like it is talking about
            people, the individuals in a study could be things, even abstract things like

                The individuals in a study about a democratic election might be
                <em>the voters</em>. But if you are going to make an accurate
                prediction of who will win the election, it is important to be more precise
                about what exactly is the population of all of those individuals [voters]
                that you intend to study: is it <em>all eligible voters</em>, <em>all

                If you want to study if a coin is <q>fair</q> or not, you would flip it repeatedly.
                The individuals would then be <em>flips of that coin</em>, and the population
                might be something like <em>all the flips ever done in the past and all that
                will ever be done in the future</em>. These individuals are quite abstract, and
                in fact it is impossible ever to get your hands on all of them (the ones in the

              <p>
                Suppose we're interested in studying whether doing more homework helps students
                do better in their studies. So shouldn't the individuals be the students?
                Well, which students? How about we look only at college students. Which
                college students? OK, how about students at 4-year colleges and universities
                in the United States, over the last five years<mdash/>after all, things might be
                different in other countries and other historical periods.
              </p>
              <p>
                Wait, a particular student might sometimes do a lot of homework and sometimes
                do very little. And what exactly does <q>do better in their studies</q> mean? So
                maybe we should look at each student in each class they take, then we can look
                at the homework they did for that class and the success they had in it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Therefore, the individuals in this study would be <em>individual experiences
                that students in US 4-year colleges and universities had in the last five
                years</em>, and population of the study would essentially be the collection of all
                the names on all class rosters of courses in the last five years at all US
                4-year colleges and universities.

            When doing an actual scientific study, we are usually not interested so much

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>

            The variable is something which (as the name says) <em>varies</em>, in the sense

            (although that is not necessary).

                There are several variables we might use in

                that course</em>. Both of those would be quantitative

              <p>
                A categorical variable for the same

            In many [most?] interesting studies, the population is too large for it to be
            practical to go observe the values of some interesting variable. Sometimes it
            is not just impractical, but actually impossible<mdash/>think of the example we gave
            of all the flips of the coin, even the ones in the future. So instead, we

            Later we shall discuss how to pick a good sample, and how much we can learn
            about a population from looking at the values of a variable of interest only
            for the individuals in a sample. For the rest of this chapter, however, let's
            just consider what to do with these sample values.

          <title>Visual Representation of Data, I: Categorical Variables</title>
          <p>
            Suppose we have a population and variable in which we are interested. We get
            a sample, which could be large or small, and look at the values of our
            variable for the individuals in that sample. We shall informally refer to
            this collection of values as a <term>dataset</term>.
          </p>

          <p>
            In this section, we suppose also that the variable we are looking at is
            categorical. Then we can summarize the dataset by telling which categorical
            values did we see for the individuals in the sample, and how often we saw
            those values.
          </p>

          <p>
            There are two ways we can make pictures of this information: <em>bar charts</em>
            and <em>pie charts</em>.

            <title>Bar Charts I: Frequency Charts</title>
            <p>
              We can take the values which we saw for individuals in the sample along the
              <m>x</m>-axis of a graph, and over each such label make a box whose height indicates
              how many individuals had that value<mdash/>the <term>frequency</term> of occurrence of
              that value.
            </p>

            <p>
              This is called a <term>bar chart</term>. As with all graphs, you
              should <em>always label all axes.</em> The <m>x</m>-axis will be labeled with some
              description of the variable in question, the <m>y</m>-axis label will always be
              <q>frequency</q> (or some synonym like <q>count</q> or <q>number of times</q>).

            <p>
              There is a variant of the above kind of bar chart which actually looks nearly
              the same but changes the labels on the <m>y</m>-axis. That is, instead of making
              the height of each bar be how many times each categorical value occurred, we
              could make it be <em>what fraction of the sample had that categorical

            <title>Bar Charts III: Cautions</title>
            <p>
              Notice that with bar charts (of either frequency or relative frequency) the
              variable values along the <m>x</m>-axis <em>can appear in any order whatsoever</em>.
              This means that any conclusion you draw from looking at the bar chart must
              not depend upon that order. For example, it would be foolish to say that the
              graph in <xref ref="eg-flipsbarchartfreq"/> <q>shows an increasing
              trend,</q> since it would make just as much sense to put the bars in the other
              order and then <q>show a decreasing trend</q><mdash/>both are meaningless.
            </p>

            <p>
              For relative frequency bar charts, in particular, note that the total of
              the heights of all the bars must be <m>1</m> (or <m>100\%</m>). If it is more, something
              is weird; if it is less, some data has been lost.
            </p>

            <p>
              Finally, it makes sense for both kinds of bar charts for the <m>y</m>-axis to
              run from the logical minimum to maximum. For frequency charts, this means it
              should go from <m>0</m> to <m>n</m> (the sample size). For relative frequency charts,
              it should go from <m>0</m> to <m>1</m> (or <m>100\%</m>). Skimping on how much of this
              appropriate <m>y</m>-axis is used is a common trick to lie with statistics.

              <title>Misleading Bar Chart with Bad Y-Axis</title>
              <statement>
                <p>
                  The coin we looked at in <xref ref="eg-flipsbarchartfreq"/> and
                  <xref ref="eg-flipsbarchartrelfreq"/> could well be a fair coin<mdash/>it didn't
                  show exactly half heads and half tails, but it was pretty close. Someone who
                  was trying to claim, deceptively, that the coin was not fair might have shown
                  only a portion of the <m>y</m>-axis, making the difference appear much more dramatic.

                </p>
                <p>
                  This is actually, in a strictly technical sense, a correct graph. But, looking
                  at it, one might conclude that T seems to occur more than twice as often as
                  H, so the coin is probably not fair<ellipsis/> until a careful examination of the
                  <m>y</m>-axis shows that even though the bar for T is more than twice as high as the
                  bar for H, that is an artifact of how much of the <m>y</m>-axis is being shown.
                </p>

            </example>

            <p>
              In summary, bar charts actually don't have all that much use in sophisticated
              statistics, but are extremely common in the popular press (and on web sites
              and so on).

              Another way to make a picture with categorical data is to use the fractions
              from a relative frequency bar chart, but not for the heights of bars, instead

                  wedges: one for H taking up 40% of the pie, and one for T taking up 60%.

            <p>
              Pie charts are widely used, but actually they are almost never a good choice.
              In fact, do an Internet search for the phrase <q>pie charts are bad</q> and there
              will be many hits. Many of the arguments are quite insightful.
            </p>

            <p>
              When you see a pie chart, it is either an attempt (misguided, though) by
              someone to be folksy and friendly, or it is a sign that the author is quite
              unsophisticated with data visualization, or, worst of all, it might be a sign
              that the author is trying to use mathematical methods in a deceptive way.
            </p>

            <p>
              In addition, all of the cautions we mentioned above for bar charts of
              categorical data apply, mostly in exactly the same way, for pie charts.

          <p>
            Now suppose we have a population and <em>quantitative</em>
            variable in which we
            are interested. We get a sample, which could be large or small, and look at
            the values of our variable for the individuals in that sample. There are
            two ways we tend to make pictures of datasets like this: <em>stem-and-leaf
            plots</em> and <em>histograms</em>.
          </p>
          <subsection xml:id="ssec-SalP">
            <title>Stem-and-leaf Plots</title>

            <idx>stem-and-leaf plot, stemplot</idx>
            <p>
              One somewhat old-fashioned way to handle a modest amount of quantitative data
              produces something between simply a list of all the data values and a graph.
              It's not a bad technique to know about in case one has to write down a dataset
              by hand, but very tedious <mdash/> and quite unnecessary, if one uses modern
              electronic tools instead <mdash/> if the dataset has more than a couple dozen values.
              The easiest case of this technique is where the data are all whole numbers in
              the range <m>0-99</m>. In that case, one can take off the tens place of each
              number <mdash/> call it the <term>stem</term> <mdash/> and put it on the
              left side of a vertical bar, and then line up all the ones places <mdash/> each is a
              <term>leaf</term> <mdash/> to the right of that stem. The whole
              thing is called a <term>stem-and-leaf plot</term>
              or, sometimes, just a <term>stemplot</term>.
            </p>

            <p>
              It's important not to skip any stems which are in the middle of the dataset,
              even if there are no corresponding leaves. It is also a good idea to allow
              repeated leaves, if there are repeated numbers in the dataset, so that the
              length of the row of leaves will give a good representation of how much
              data is in that general group of data values.

              The most important visual representation of quantitative data is a
              <term>histogram</term>. Histograms actually look a lot like a stem-and-leaf plot,
              except turned on its side and with the row of numbers turned into a vertical
              bar, like a bar graph. The height of each of these bars would be how many
            </p>

            <p>
              Another way of saying that is that we would be making bars whose heights were
              determined by how many scores were in each group of ten. Note there is still
              a question of into which bar a value right on the edge would count: <em>e.g.,</em>
              does the data value <m>50</m> count in the bar to the left of that number, or the
              bar to the right? It doesn't actually matter which side, but it is important
              to state which choice is being made.

                  put data values on the edges in the bar to the right <mdash/> we get the

            <p>
              Actually, there is no reason that the bars always have to be ten units wide:
              it is important that they are all the same size and that how they handle the
              edge cases (whether the left or right bar gets a data value on edge), but
              they could be any size. We call the successive ranges of the <m>x</m> coordinates
              which get put together for each bar
              <term>bins</term> or
              <term>classes</term>, and it is up to the statistician
              to chose whichever bins <mdash/> where they start and how wide they are <mdash/> shows the
              data best.
            </p>

            <p>
              Typically, the smaller the bin size, the more variation (precision) can be
              seen in the bars <ellipsis/> but sometimes there is so much variation that the result
              seems to have a lot of random jumps up and down, like static on the radio.
              On the other hand, using a large bin size makes the picture smoother <ellipsis/> but
              sometimes, it is so smooth that very little information is left. Some of this
              is shown in the following

              if the histogram is <q>noisy,</q> maybe multimodal. Similarly, looking at a

          <title>Numerical Descriptions of Data, I: Measures of the Center</title>
          <p>
            Oddly enough, there are several measures of central tendency, as ways to
            define the middle of a dataset are called.  There is different work to be
            done to calculate each of them, and they have different uses, strengths, and
            weaknesses.
          </p>

          <p>
            For this whole section we will assume we have collected <m>n</m> numerical values,
            the values of our quantitative
            variable<idx>quantitative variable</idx><idx>variable!quantitative</idx> for the
            sample we were able to study.  When we write formulæ with these values,
            we can't give them variable names that look like <m>a, b, c, \dots</m>, because we
            don't know where to stop (and what would we do if <m>n</m> were more than 26?).
            Instead, we'll use the variables <m>x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n</m> to represent the data
            values.
          </p>

          <p>
            One more very convenient bit of notation, once we have started writing an
            unknown number (<m>n</m>) of numbers <m>x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n</m>, is a way of writing
            their sum:
          </p>

            <idx>pig, yellow</idx>
            <statement>
              <p>
                If we have <m>n</m> numbers which we write <m>x_1, \dots, x_n</m>, then we use the
                shorthand <term>summation notation</term> <m>\sum x_i</m> to represent the sum
                <m>\sum x_i = x_1 + \dots + x_n</m>.  <fn>Sometimes you will see this written
                instead <m>\sum_{i=1}^n x_i</m>.  Think of the <q><m>\sum_{i=1}^n{}</m></q>
                as a little computer program which with <m>i=1</m>, increases it one step at a time
                until it gets all the way to <m>i=n</m>, and adds up whatever is to the right.  So,
                for example, <m>\sum_{i=1}^3 2i</m> would be <m>(2*1)+(2*2)+(2*3)</m>, and so has the value <m>12</m>.</fn>

              What this example shows is that a small change in some of the data values,
              small enough not to change the histogram at all, can change the mode(s)
              drastically.  It also shows that the location of the mode says very little
              about the data in general or its shape, the mode is based entirely on a
              possibly accidental coincidence of some values in the dataset, no matter if

              the others, can change the mean quite a bit.  Here is an example.

                  there are now an odd number of data values, so the median is the middle one
                  after they are put in order, which is 78.  So the median has changed by only
                  half a point, from 77.5 to 78.   And this would even be true if the value we

              Since, in practice, it is very easy for datasets to have a few random, bad
              values (typos, mechanical errors, <em>etc.</em>), which are often outliers, it
              is usually smarter to use the median than the mean.
            </p>

            <p>
              As one final point, note that as we mentioned in <xref ref="ssec-Mean"/>, the
              word <q>average,</q> the unsophisticated version of <q>mean,</q> is often incorrectly
              used as a modifier of the individuals in some population being studied (as in
              <q>the average American ...</q>), rather than as a modifier of the variable in
              the study (<q>the average income...</q>), indicating a fundamental misunderstanding
              of what the mean <em>means</em>.  If you look a little harder at this
              misunderstanding, though, perhaps it is based on the idea that we are looking
              for the center, the <q>typical</q> value of the variable.
            </p>

            <p>
              The mode might seem like a good way <mdash/> it's the most frequently occurring
              value.  But we have seen how that is somewhat flawed.
            </p>

            <p>
              The mean might also seem like a good way <mdash/> it's the <q>average,</q> literally.
              But we've also seen problems with the mean.
            </p>

            <p>
              In fact, the median is probably closest to the intuitive idea of <q>the center
              of the data.</q>  It is, after all, a value with the property that both above
              and below that value lie half of the data values.
            </p>

            <p>
              One last example to underline this idea:
            </p>

            <example xml:id="eg-meanmedianincome">

              <idx>Great Recession</idx>
              <statement>
                <p>
                  The period of economic difficulty for world markets in the late 2000s and early
                  2010s is sometimes called the <term>Great Recession</term>.  Suppose a politician says
                  that we have come out of that time of troubles, and gives as proof the fact
                  that the average family income has increased from the low value it had during
                  the Great Recession back to the values it had before then, and perhaps is even
                  higher than it was in 2005.
                </p>

                <p>
                  It is possible that in fact people are better off, as the increase in this
                  average <mdash/> mean <mdash/> seems to imply.  But it is also possible that while the mean
                  income has gone up, the <em>median</em> income is still low.  This would happen
                  if the histogram of incomes recently still has most of the tall bars down
                  where the variable (family income) is low, but has a few, very high outliers.
                  In short, if the super-rich have gotten even super-richer, that will make the
                  mean (average) go up, even if most of the population has experienced stagnant
                  or decreasing wages <mdash/> but the median will tell what is happening to most of
                  the population.
                </p>

                <p>
                  So when a politician uses the evidence of the average (mean) as suggested here,
                  it is possible they are trying to hide from the public the reality of what is
                  happening to the rich and the not-so-rich.  It is also possible that this
                  politician is simply poorly educated in statistics and doesn't realize what is
                  going on.  You be the judge ... but pay attention so you know what to ask about.

              The last thing we need to say about the strengths and weaknesses of our
              different measures of central tendency is a way to use the weaknesses of the
              mean and median to our advantage.  That is, since the mean is sensitive to
              outliers<idx>sensitive to outliers</idx>, and pulled in the direction of those outliers, while the median is
              not, we can use the difference between the two to tell us which way a histogram

              The simplest<mdash/>and least useful<mdash/>measure of the spread<idx>spread of a histogram, dataset, or distribution</idx> of
              some data is literally how much space on the <m>x</m>-axis the histogram takes up.
              To define this, first a bit of convenient notation:

              The thing to notice here is that since the idea of outliers is that they are

              will definitely be what value gets called <m>x_{min}</m> or <m>x_{max}</m> (or both).  So
              <term>the range is supremely sensitive to outliers</term><idx>sensitive to outliers</idx>: if there are any outliers,
              the range will be determined exactly by them, and not by what the typical data

            <p>
              Let's try to find a substitute for the range which is not so sensitive to
              outliers.  We want to see how far apart not the maximum and minimum of the
              whole dataset are, but instead how far apart are the typical larger
              values in the dataset and the typical smaller values.  How can we measure
              these typical larger and smaller?  One way is to define these in terms of the
              typical<mdash/>central<mdash/>value of the upper half of the data and the typical
              value of the lower half of the data.  Here is the definition we shall use for
              that concept:

              Note that the first quartile is halfway through the lower half of the data.
              In other words, it is a value such that one quarter of the data is smaller.

              build one.
            </p>

            <p>
              Suppose the data is sample data.  Then how far a particular data value <m>x_i</m>
              is from the sample mean <m>\overline{x}</m><idx>sample mean, <m>\overline{x}</m></idx><idx><h>mean</h><h>sample</h></idx><idx><h>notation</h><h><m>\overline{x}</m>, sample mean</h></idx>
              is just <m>x_i-\overline{x}</m>.  So the mean displacement from the mean, the mean
              of <m>x_i-\overline{x}</m>, should be a good measure of variability, shouldn't it?
            </p>

            <p>
              Unfortunately, it turns out that the mean of
              <m>x_i-\overline{x}</m><idx>sample mean, <m>\overline{x}</m></idx><idx><h>mean</h><h>sample</h></idx><idx><h>notation</h><h><m>\overline{x}</m>, sample mean</h></idx> is always 0.  This
              is because when <m>x_i>\overline{x}</m>, <m>x_i-\overline{x}</m> is positive, while
              when <m>x_i&lt;\overline{x}</m>, <m>x_i-\overline{x}</m> is negative, and it turns out
              that the positives always exactly cancel the negatives (see if you can prove
              this algebraically, it's not hard).
            </p>

            <p>
              We therefore need to make the numbers

              taking their mean.  One way to do this is to square them all.  Then we take
              something which is almost the mean of these squared numbers to get another
              measure of spread<idx>spread of a histogram, dataset, or distribution</idx> or variability:

            <p>
              Why do we take the square root in that sample standard deviation?  The answer
              is that the measure we build should have the property that if all the numbers
              are made twice as big, then the measure of spread<idx>spread of a histogram, dataset, or distribution</idx> should also be
              twice as big.  Or, for example, if we first started working with data measured
              in feet and then at some point decided to work in inches, the numbers would
              all be 12 times as big, and it would make sense if the measure of spread were
              also 12 times as big.
            </p>

            <p>
              The variance does not have this property: if the data are all doubled, the
              variance increases by a factor of 4.  Or if the data are all multiplied by 12,
              the variance is multiplied by a factor of 144.
            </p>

            <p>
              If we take the square root of the variance, though, we get back to the nice
              property of doubling data doubles the measure of spread<idx>spread of a histogram, dataset, or distribution</idx>,
              <em>etc.</em>  For this reason, while we have defined the variance on its own
              and some calculators, computers, and on-line tools will tell the variance
              whenever you ask them to computer 1-variable statistics, we will in this
              class only consider the variance a stepping stone on the way to the real
              measure of spread of data, the standard deviation.
            </p>

            <p>
              One last thing we should define in this section.  For technical reasons that
              we shall not go into now, the definition of standard deviation is slightly
              different if we are working with population data and not sample data:

          <subsection xml:id="ssec-AFDoO">
            <title>A Formal Definition of Outliers<mdash/>the <m>1.5\,IQR</m> Rule</title>
            <p>
              So far, we have said that outliers<idx>outlier</idx> are simply data that are
              <em>atypical</em>.  We need a precise definition that can be carefully checked.
              What we will use is a formula (well, actually two formulæ) that describe
              that idea of an outlier being <em>far away from the rest of data</em>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Actually, since outliers should be far away either in being significantly
              bigger than the rest of the data or in being significantly smaller, we should
              take a value on the upper side of the rest of the data, and another on the
              lower side, as the starting points for this <em>far away</em>.  We can't pick
              the <m>x_{max}</m><idx><h>notation</h><h><m>x_{max}</m>, maximum value in dataset</h></idx> and
              <m>x_{min}</m><idx><h>notation</h><h><m>x_{min}</m>, minimum value in dataset</h></idx> as those starting
              points, since they will be the outliers themselves, as we have noticed.  So
              we will use our earlier idea of a value which is typical for the larger part
              of the data, the quartile<idx>quartile</idx> <m>Q_3</m><idx><h>notation</h><h><m>Q_3</m>, third quartile</h></idx>,
              and <m>Q_1</m><idx><h>notation</h><h><m>Q_1</m>, first quartile</h></idx> for the corresponding
              lower part of the data.
            </p>

            <p>
              Now we need to decide how far is <em>far enough away</em> from those quartiles
              to count as an outlier.  If the data already has a lot of variation, then a
              new data value would have to be quite far in order for us to be sure that it
              is not out there just because of the variation already in the data.  So our
              measure of <em>far enough</em> should be in terms of a measure of
              spread<idx>spread of a histogram, dataset, or distribution</idx> of the data.
            </p>

            <p>
              Looking at the last section, we see that only the
              <m>IQR</m><idx><h>notation</h><h><m>IQR</m>, inter-quartile range</h></idx> is a measure of
              spread<idx>spread of a histogram, dataset, or distribution</idx> which is insensitive to outliers<idx>insensitive to outliers</idx><mdash/>and we definitely
              don't want to use a measure which is sensitive to the outliers<idx>sensitive to outliers</idx>, one which
              would have been affected by the very outliers we are trying to define.

                Suppose you go to the supermarket every week for a year and buy a bag of
                flour, packaged by a major national flour brand, which is labelled as weighing
                <m>1kg</m>. You take the bag home and weigh it on an extremely accurate scale
                that measures to the nearest <m>{1/100}^{th}</m> of a gram. After the 52 weeks of
                the year of flour buying, you make a histogram of the accurate weights of the
                bags. What do you think that histogram will look like? Will it be symmetric
                or skewed left or right (which one?), where will its center be, will it show
                a lot of variation/spread or only a little? Explain why you think each of
                the things you say.

                What about if you buy a <m>1kg</m> loaf of bread from the local artisanal bakery

              <p>
                If you said that those histograms were symmetric, can you think of a
                measurement you would make in a grocery store or bakery which would be
                skewed; and if you said the histograms for flour and loaf weights were skewed,
                can you think of one which would be symmetric? (Explain why, always, of
                course.) [If you think one of the two above histograms was skewed and one was
                symmetric (with explanation), you don't need to come up with another one here.]
